Conflicts with the band 's management led to Plant leaving the group after a few months . He quickly tried to form his own Band of Joy , but it soon folded . A third incarnation of the band , including Plant 's friend John Bonham ( they had met only two years earlier in late 1965 when Bonham joined The Crawling King Snakes ) , lasted from 1967 to mid-1968 . This line - up included Kevyn Gammond on guitar and Paul Lockey on bass . Their brand of soul and blues was popular with Birmingham mods . This line - up recorded a number of demo recordings in early 1968 , but broke up in May 1968 when a recording contract failed to materialise . </P> <P> Albeit briefly , lead guitar duties were taken by Dave Pegg , who later played the bass guitar with Fairport Convention and Jethro Tull . Pegg rehearsed with Band of Joy but did not tour with them . </P> <P> For a 1968 tour of Scotland , Plant and Bonham co-opted bassist John Hill ( ex-Uncle Joseph ) and guitarist Mick Strode to fill in a temporary line - up . </P> <H2> 1977 -- 1978 ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1977 Gammond and Paul Lockey revived Band of Joy , rounding out the line - up with John Pasternak , Peter Robinson , and keyboardist Michael Chetwood . Gammond , Lockey , Pasternak and Robinson had previously played in Bronco . The two albums recorded under this line - up went on to define the trademark cult sound of the band , with progressive melodies , blues hooks and experimentation with new sounds blending the sounds of the punk movement with classic genres of rock , blues and progressive influences .

It encompasses the entire NCT of Delhi and several districts surrounding it from the states of Haryana , Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan . The NCR and the associated National Capital Region Planning Board were created in 1985 to plan the development of the region and to evolve harmonized policies for the control of land - uses and development of infrastructure in the region . Prominent cities of NCR include Delhi , Gurugram , Noida , Faridabad , Sonipat , Bahadurgarh , Ghaziabad , Muzaffarnagar and Meerut . </P> <P> The NCR is a rural - urban region , with a population of over 46,069,000 and an urbanization level of 62.6 % . As well as the cities and towns the NCR contains ecologically sensitive areas like the Aravalli ridge , forests , wildlife and bird sanctuaries . The Delhi Extended Urban Agglomeration , a part of the NCR , contributed $370 billion or roughly 4 % to the Indian economy ( measured in terms of GDP PPP ) in 2015 - 16 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Component districts </Li> <Li> 3 Regional planning </Li> <Li> 4 Central National Capital Region </Li> <Li> 5 Counter magnets </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The National Capital Region ( NCR ) and its planning board were created under the National Capital Region Planning Board Act of 1985 . That 1985 Act defined the NCR as being the whole of NCT of Delhi ; the Haryana districts of Gurgaon , Faridabad and Sonipat , Rohtak ( then including Jhajjar ) and the Rewari tehsils then in Mahendragarh ; and the Uttar Pradesh districts of Bulandshahr , Meerut and Ghaziabad ( including Hapur Tehsil ) , and some of the Rajasthan district of Alwar . The 1985 boundary of the NCR covered an area of 34,144 km . </P> <P> Gautam Budh Nagar district was created in 1997 out of the existing NCR districts of Ghaziabad and Bulandshahr . The city of Noida was the location of the new district 's headquarters . Also in 1997 Baghpat district was created from Baghpat tehsil of Meerut district . </P> <P> In July 2013 , NCR was expanded to include three more districts , Bhiwani , and Mahendragarh in the state of Haryana , as well as Bharatpur in the state of Rajasthan . This brought the number of districts in the NCR to 19 ( outside Delhi NCT ) , with the total NCR area increasing 34 % to 45,887 km . Subsequently , Charkhi Dadri district was separated from Bhiwani district in 2016 . </P> <P> On 9 June 2015 the Government of India approved the inclusion of three more districts in NCR - Jind and Karnal in the state of Haryana and Muzaffarnagar in U.P. covering a total area of 50,566 km . Shamli district of U.P. was added to the NCR in December 2017 . There are now a total of 24 districts in the NCR ( outside Delhi NCT ) . </P> <P> On 9 January 2018 the government of Uttar Pradesh formally proposed the extension of the NCR to cover Aligarh , Bijnor , Hathras and Mathura . It is also pushing to have the district of Agra included in the NCR . Punjab is also forcing to have Patiala , Dera Bassi and Mohali included in the NCR . Outskirts of Rajasthan like Bhadra are also included in the Future Extension plans . </P> <P> Prior to the creation of the NCR , an area described as the Delhi Metropolitan Area ( DMA ) was described in the 1962 Master Plan for Delhi . That plan defined the DMA as comprising the Union Territory of Delhi and the ring towns of Ghaziabad , Faridabad , Ballabgarh , Gurgaon , Bahadurgarh and Loni , also certain rural areas , which had a population of the somewhat less than 2.1 million in 1951 . The following `` Master Plan for Delhi '' , approved in August 1990 , added Noida , Bahadurgarh and the then - proposed township of Kundli to the DMA , which consequently covered an area of 3,182 km . </P> <H2> Component districts ( edit ) </H2> <P> A total of 24 districts in three neighbouring states of Haryana , Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan along with whole of the National Capital Territory of Delhi constitute the National Capital Region ( NCR ) of India . </P> <P> The areas and populations ( per 2011 census , prior to the addition of Muzaffarnagar , Jind , Karnal and Shamli ) of these component districts are set out below : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> State </Th> <Th> Districts </Th> <Th> Area </Th> <Th> Population ( in thousands ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Uttar Pradesh </Td> <Td> Meerut </Td> <Td> 14,727 </Td> <Td> 14,576 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Muzaffarnagar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ghaziabad </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Gautam Budh Nagar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Bulandshahr </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Baghpat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hapur </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Shamli </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Haryana </Td> <Td> Faridabad </Td> <Td> 25,327 </Td> <Td> 11,031 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Gurgaon </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mahendragarh </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Bhiwani </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Charkhi Dadri </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Nuh </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Rohtak </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Panipat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sonipat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Rewari </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jhajjar </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Palwal </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Jind </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Karnal </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Rajasthan </Td> <Td> Alwar </Td> <Td> 13,447 </Td> <Td> 3,674 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Bharatpur </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> NCT Delhi </Td> <Td> NCT Delhi </Td> <Td> 1,483 </Td> <Td> 16,788 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Total </Td> <Td> 54,984 </Td> <Td> 46,069 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Regional Planning ( edit ) </H2> <P> The planning body for the region is the National Capital Region Planning Board ( NCRPB ) . It has issued two regional plans , the `` Regional Plan 2001 , National Capital Region '' approved in 1988 , and the `` Regional Plan 2021 , National Capital Region '' approved in 2005 . </P> <P> Topics covered by the 2001 plan included transport , telecommunications , power and water supply , waste and sewerage , education , health , the environment , housing and the `` counter magnet '' areas . The 2021 plan extended these with the additional topics of social infrastructure , heritage , tourism , rural development and disaster management . </P> <Dl> <Dt> Sewage connectivity </Dt> </Dl> <P> About 46 % of the National Capital Region , home to 40 to 50 million people , is not connected to sewage networks . Sewage from these areas flows into stormwater drains that empty directly into the Yamuna . </P> <H2> Central National Capital Region ( edit ) </H2> <P> The 2001 regional plan defined the `` Delhi Metropolitan Area '' ( DMA ) as including Ghaziabad , Noida , Faridabad , Gurgaon , Bahadurgarh and Kundli Sonipat . The 2021 plan renamed the area as the `` Central National Capital Region '' ( CNCR ) , covering about 2,000 km in addition to the 1,483 km of NCT Delhi . </P> <P> The 2021 plan estimated the 2001 population of the CNCR outside of Delhi NCT to be over 2.8 million , while Delhi NCT 's population was 13.8 million , yielding a total CNCR population of 16.6 million . As of 2016 the most recent population estimates have spanned 25.7 to 26.5 million people . </P> <H2> Counter magnets ( edit ) </H2> <P> The 1985 Act ( \\u00a7 2. c and \\u00a7 8. f ) gives the NCRCB has the ability to select districts outside of the NCR to act as counter magnets , with a view to developing them further . Counter-magnet cities are identified as those that can be developed as alternative centres of growth and attract migrants to them rather than Delhi . The criteria for selecting counter magnet towns are : that they should have their own established roots and potential of growth , and should not be centres of either religious , strategic or environmental importance . The counter magnet cities should be given priority when allocating funding for development of land , housing and infrastructure . </P> <P> These cities , with their distances from the NCR , are : </P> <P> In Haryana state </P> <Ul> <Li> Hisar , 160 km </Li> <Li> Ambala , 200 km </Li> </Ul> <P> In Madhya Pradesh state </P> <Ul> <Li> Gwalior ( particularly Gwalior West ) , 320 km </Li> </Ul> <P> In Punjab state </P> <Ul> <Li> Patiala , 230 km </Li> </Ul> <P> In Rajasthan state </P> <Ul> <Li> Jaipur , 268 km </Li> <Li> Kota , 525 km </Li> </Ul> <P> In Uttar Pradesh state </P> <Ul> <Li> Bareilly , 250 km </Li> <Li> Kanpur , 470 km </Li> </Ul> <P> In Uttarakhand </P> <Ul> <Li> Dehradun , 240 km </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> India portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Mumbai Metropolitan Region </Li> <Li> National Capital Region Transport Corporation </Li> <Li> NCR Proposed Transport Plan </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Census 2011 '' ( PDF ) .

      "    \"text\": \"Egocentrism - wikipedia <H1> Egocentrism </H1> Not to be confused with Narcissism . Egocentrism <P> Egocentrism is the inability to differentiate between self and other . More specifically , it is the inability to untangle subjective schemas from objective reality and an inability to understand or assume any perspective other than one 's own . </P> <P> Although egocentrism and narcissism appear similar , they are not the same . A person who is egocentric believes they are the center of attention , like a narcissist , but does not receive gratification by one 's own admiration . Both egotists and narcissists are people whose egos are greatly influenced by the approval of others , while for egocentrists this may or may not be true . </P> <P> Although egocentric behaviors are less prominent in adulthood , the existence of some forms of egocentrism in adulthood indicates that overcoming egocentrism may be a lifelong development that never achieves completion . Adults appear to be less egocentric than children because they are faster to correct from an initially egocentric perspective than children , not because they are less likely to initially adopt an egocentric perspective . </P> <P> Therefore , egocentrism is found across the life span : in infancy , early childhood , adolescence , and adulthood . It contributes to the human cognitive development by helping children develop theory of mind and self - identity formation . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 During infancy </Li> <Li> 2 During childhood </Li> <Li> 3 During adolescence </Li> <Li> 4 During adulthood </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> During infancy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The main concept infants and young children learn by beginning to show egocentrism is the fact that their thoughts , values , and behaviors are different from those of others , also known as the theory of mind . Initially when children begin to have social interactions with others , mainly the caregivers , they misinterpret that they are one entity , because they are together for a long duration of time and the caregivers often provide for the children 's needs . For example , a child may misattribute the act of their mother reaching to retrieve an object that they point to as a sign that they are the same entity , when in fact they are actually separate individuals . As early as 15 months old , children show a mix of egocentrism and theory of mind when an agent acts inconsistently with how the children expect him to behave . In this study the children observed the experimenter place a toy inside one of two boxes , but did not see when the experimenter removed the toy from the original box and placed it in the other box , due to obstruction by a screen . When the screen was removed the children watched the experimenter reach to take the toy out of one of the boxes , yet because the children did not see the switching part , they looked at the experimenter 's action much longer when she reached for the box opposite to the one she originally put the toy in . Not only does this show the existence of infants ' memory capacity , but it also demonstrates how they have expectations based on their knowledge , as they are surprised when those expectations are not met . </P> <H2> During childhood ( edit ) </H2> <P> According to George Butterworth and Margaret Harris , during childhood , one is usually unable to distinguish between what is subjective and objective . According to Piaget , `` an egocentric child assumes that other people see , hear , and feel exactly the same as the child does . '' </P> <P> Jean Piaget ( 1896 -- 1980 ) developed a theory about the development of human intelligence , describing the stages of cognitive development . He claimed that early childhood is the time of pre-operational thought , characterized by children 's inability to process logical thought . According to Piaget , one of the main obstacles to logic that children possess includes centration , `` the tendency to focus on one aspect of a situation to the exclusion of others . '' A particular type of centration is egocentrism -- literally , `` self - centeredness . '' Piaget claimed that young children are egocentric , capable of contemplating the world only from their personal perspective . For example , a three - year - old presented his mother a model truck as her birthday present ; `` he had carefully wrapped the present and gave it to his mother with an expression that clearly showed he expected her to love it . '' The three - year - old boy had not chosen the present out of selfishness or greediness , but he simply failed to realize that , from his mother 's perspective , she might not enjoy the model car as much as he would . </P> <P> Piaget was concerned with two aspects of egocentricity in children : language and morality . He believed that egocentric children use language primarily for communication with oneself . Piaget observed that children would talk to themselves during play , and this egocentric speech was merely the child 's thoughts . He believed that this speech had no special function ; it was used as a way of accompanying and reinforcing the child 's current activity . He theorized that as the child matures cognitively and socially the amount of egocentric speech used would be reduced . However , Vygotsky felt that egocentric speech has more meaning , as it allows the child 's growth in social speech and high mental development . In addition to Piaget 's theory , he believed that when communicating with others , the child believes that others know everything about the topic of discussion and become frustrated when asked to give further detail . </P> <P> Piaget also believed that egocentrism affects the child 's sense of morality . Due to egocentrism , the child is only concerned with the final outcome of an event rather than another 's intentions . For example , if someone breaks the child 's toy , the child would not forgive the other and the child would not be able to understand that the person who broke the toy did not intend to break it . This phenomenon can also be backed by the evidence from the findings of the case study by Nelson , who studied the use of motives and outcomes by young children as aiding to form their moral judgements . </P> <P> Piaget did a test to investigate egocentrism called the mountains study . He put children in front of a simple plaster mountain range and then asked them to pick from four pictures the view that he , Piaget , would see . The younger children before age seven picked the picture of the view they themselves saw and were therefore found to lack the ability to appreciate a viewpoint different from their own . In other words , their way of reasoning was egocentric . Only when entering the concrete - operational stage of development at age seven to twelve , children became less egocentric and could appreciate viewpoints other than their own . In other words , they were capable of cognitive perspective - taking . However , the mountains test has been criticized for judging only the child 's visuo - spatial awareness , rather than egocentrism . A follow up study involving police dolls showed that even young children were able to correctly say what the interviewer would see . It is thought that Piaget overestimated the extent of egocentrism in children . Egocentrism is thus the child 's inability to see other people 's viewpoints , not to be confused with selfishness . The child at this stage of cognitive development assumes that their view of the world is the same as other peoples . </P> <P> In addition , a more well - known experiment by Wimmer and Perner ( 1983 ) called the false - belief task demonstrates how children show their acquisition of theory of mind ( ToM ) as early as 4 years old . In this task , children see a scenario where one character hides a marble in a basket , walks out of the scene , and another character that is present takes out the marble and put it in a box . Knowing that the first character did not see the switching task , children were asked to predict where the first character would look to find the marble . The results show that children younger than 4 answer that the character would look inside the box , because they have the superior knowledge of where the marble actually is . It shows egocentric thinking in early childhood because they thought that even if the character itself did not see the entire scenario , it has the same amount of knowledge as oneself and therefore should look inside the box to find the marble . As children start to acquire ToM , their ability to recognize and process others ' beliefs and values overrides the natural tendency to be egocentric . </P> <H2> During adolescence ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Adolescent egocentrism <P> Although most of the research completed on the study of egocentrism is primarily focused on early childhood development , it has been found to also occur during adolescence . David Elkind was one of the first to discover the presence of egocentrism in adolescence and late adolescence . He argues , `` the young adolescent , because of the physiological metamorphosis he is undergoing , is primarily concerned with himself . Accordingly , since he fails to differentiate between what others are thinking about and his own mental preoccupations , he assumes that other people are obsessed with his behavior and appearance as he is himself . '' This shows that the adolescent is exhibiting egocentrism , by struggling to distinguish whether or not , in actuality , others are as fond of them as they might think because their own thoughts are so prevalent . Adolescents consider themselves as `` unique , special , and much more socially significant than they actually are . '' </P> <P> Elkind also created terms to help describe the egocentric behaviors exhibited by the adolescent population such as what he calls an imaginary audience , the personal fable , and the invincibility fable . Usually when an egocentric adolescent is experiencing an imaginary audience , it entails the belief that there is an audience captivated and constantly present to an extent of being overly interested about the egocentric individual . Personal fable refers to the idea that many teenagers believe their thoughts , feelings , and experiences are unique and more extreme than anyone else 's . In the invincibility fable , the adolescent believes in the idea that he or she is immune to misfortune and can not be harmed by things that might defeat a normal person . Egocentrism in adolescence is often viewed as a negative aspect of their thinking ability because adolescents become consumed with themselves and are unable to effectively function in society due to their skewed version of reality and cynicism . </P> <P> There are various reasons as to why adolescents experience egocentrism : </P> <Ul> <Li> Adolescents are often faced with new social environments ( for example , starting secondary school ) which require the adolescent to protect the self which may lead to egocentrism . </Li> <Li> Development of the adolescent 's identity may lead to the individual experiencing high levels of uniqueness which subsequently becomes egocentric -- this manifests as the personal fable . </Li> <Li> Parental rejection may lead to the adolescents experiencing high levels of self - consciousness , which can lead to egocentrism . </Li> </Ul> <P> A study was completed on 163 undergraduate students to examine the adolescent egocentrism in college students . Students were asked to complete a self - report questionnaire to determine the level of egocentrism present . The questions simply asked for the reactions that students had to seemingly embarrassing situations . It was found that adolescent egocentrism was more prevalent in the female population than the male . This again exemplifies the idea that egocentrism is present in even late adolescence . </P> <P> Results from other studies have come to the conclusion that egocentrism does not present itself in some of the same patterns as it was found originally . More recent studies have found that egocentrism is prevalent in later years of development unlike Piaget 's original findings that suggested that egocentrism is only present in early childhood development . Egocentrism is especially dominant in early adolescence , particularly when adolescents encounter new environments , such as a new school or a new peer group . </P> <P> In addition , throughout adolescence egocentrism contributes to the development of self - identity ; in order to achieve self - identity , adolescents go through different pathways of `` crisis '' and `` commitment '' stages , and higher self - identity achievement was found to be correlated with heightened egocentrism . </P> <H2> During adulthood ( edit ) </H2> <P> The prevalence of egocentrism in the individual has been found to decrease between the ages of 15 and 16 . However , adults are also susceptible to be egocentric or to have reactions or behaviours that can be categorized as egocentric . </P> <P> Frankenberger tested adolescents ( 14 -- 18 years old ) and adults ( 20 -- 89 ) on their levels of egocentrism and self - consciousness . It was found that egocentric tendencies had extended to early adulthood and these tendencies were also present in the middle adult years . </P> <P> Baron and Hanna looked at 152 participants and tested to see how the presence of depression affected egocentrism . They tested adults between the ages of 18 and 25 and found that the participants who suffered from depression showed higher levels of egocentrism than those who did not . </P> <P> Finally , Surtees and Apperly found that when adults were asked to judge the number of dots they see and the number of dots the avatar in the computer simulation sees , the presence of the avatar interfered with the participants ' judgment - making during the trials . Specifically , these were the trials where the number of dots seen by the participant was inconsistent from the number of dots the avatar saw . Such effect on the participants diminished when the avatar was replaced with a simple yellow or blue line , which concluded that somehow the avatar having a personal attribute implicitly caused the participants to include its `` vision '' into their own decision making . That said , they made more errors when they saw prompts such as `` the avatar sees N '' when N was the number of dots the participant saw and not the avatar , which shows that egocentric thought is still predominant in making quick judgments , even if the adults are well aware that their thoughts could differ from others . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Amae </Li> <Li> Attribution ( psychology ) </Li> <Li> Chronocentrism </Li> <Li> Egoism </Li> <Li> Epistemic virtue </Li> <Li> Intellectual virtue </Li> <Li> Narcissistic defences </Li> <Li> Object relations theory </Li> <Li> Personality disorder </Li> <Li> Religiocentrism </Li> <Li> Solipsism </Li> <Li> Spoiled child </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Anderman , Eric M. ; Anderman , Lynley H.

The United States of America filed a request for consultation to the World Trade Organization , in regard to concerns that the People 's Republic of China was violating intellectual property rights . The U.S. administration is relying partly on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to prevent what it claims are unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property . This gives the president the authority to unilaterally impose fines or other penalties on a trading partner if it is deemed to be unfairly harming U.S. business interests . Trump had already , in August 2017 , opened a formal investigation into attacks on the intellectual property of the U.S. and its allies , which cost the U.S. alone an estimated $225 -- 600 billion a year . As a result of the findings of the US Trade Representative Section 301 Investigation into China , the United States claims that China enforces laws that allow them to legally avoid certain terms previously laid out by The Agreement on Trade - Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS ) . In summary , the United States believes that certain Chinese laws counteract intellectual property rights by forcing foreign companies to engage in joint ventures with Chinese companies , in which their new Chinese partners are granted access and permission to use , improve , or replicate their technologies . In addition , the United States argues that China is not compliant in recognizing legitimate patents and that their policies discriminate against foreign imported technology . Aside from the United States , several other nations have filed requests for consultation in regard to suspicions of Chinese violations , such as the European Union , Japan , Saudi Arabia , and Ukraine . </P> <P> The Trump administration said the tariffs were necessary to protect intellectual property of U.S. businesses , and to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China.As a result , China has filed counter requests for consultation against the United States , arguing that their claims lack substantive evidence , and therefore do not have the legal authority to respond based on World Trade Organization rules . As stated in Emerging Markets Finance & Trade , `` China and the US bilateral disputes have become increasingly intensive . China criticizes the US of their export restrictions on hightechnology products , their unfair treatments of China 's market economy status , and unreasonable trade sanctions on China . Major areas of concern expressed by the US include large numbers of trade surplus , relatively ineffective record of enforcing intellectual property rights ( IPR ) , discriminatory innovation policies , and mixed record on implementing WTO obligations . '' Zhang Qingli , who serves as Vice Chairman of the Committee of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference said in a statement , `` China never wants a trade war with anybody , not to mention the U.S. , who has been a long term strategic partner , but we also do not fear such a war ... The U.S. side has disregarded a consensus with China after multiple rounds of consultations , insisting on waging a trade war against China and continuing to escalate it . '' However , in a statement made by White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters she asserts , `` The goal of United States trade actions is not to harm China 's economy or start a trade war , but to get China to follow through on allowing fair competition and stop their unfair trade practices that have been hurting the American workers for years . '' Since filing for consultations with the WTO , neither parties have been able to agree on a solution . In the meantime , both the United States and China have responded by continuing to engage in trade war activities . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 United States tariffs </Li> <Li> 2 Tariff announcements </Li> <Li> 3 Rationales given for the tariffs </Li> <Li> 4 Other measures </Li> <Li> 5 Reactions <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Markets </Li> <Li> 5.2 Industry associations </Li> <Li> 5.3 Potential impact </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> United States tariffs ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Remarks by President Trump to the 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Remarks by Vice President Pence on the Administration 's Policy Toward China </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The United States International Trade Commission publishes all tariffs in the document `` Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States '' </P> <P> Generally , tariffs depends on exporting countries which are treated in one of three different groups : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1 . Privileged countries such as most developing countries and countries with trade agreements such as NAFTA . Tariffs here are zero for most products . </Li> <Li> 2 . `` Rate of duty column 2 '' is enhanced tariffs for legal trade with Cuba and North Korea </Li> <Li> 3 . All other countries . </Li> </Ul> <P> The tariffs are usually given as a percentage of value , but it can also be given per Kg weight or per unit . </P> <H2> Tariff announcements ( edit ) </H2> <P> President Trump placed a 30 % tariff on foreign solar panels on January 22 , 2018 , to be reduced to 15 % after four years . China , the world leader in solar panel manufacture , decried the tariffs . That same day , tariffs of 20 % were placed on washing machines for the first 1.2 million units imported during the year . In 2016 , China exported $425 million worth of washers to the United States . </P> <P> President Trump asked the United States Trade Representative ( USTR ) investigate applying tariffs on US $50 - 60 billion worth of Chinese goods , on March 22 . He relied on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 for doing so , stating that the proposed tariffs were `` a response to the unfair trade practices of China over the years '' , including theft of U.S. intellectual property . Over 1,300 categories of Chinese imports were listed for tariffs , including aircraft parts , batteries , flat - panel televisions , medical devices , satellites , and various weapons . </P> <P> China responded on April 2 by imposing tariffs on 128 products it imports from America , including aluminium , airplanes , cars , pork , and soybeans ( which have a 25 % tariff ) , as well as fruit , nuts , and steel piping ( 15 % ) . On April 5 , Trump responded saying that he was considering another round of tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese imports as Beijing retaliates . The next day the World Trade Organization received request from China for consultations on new U.S. tariffs . </P> <P> Vice Premier Liu He , top economic adviser to Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping , visited Washington from May 15 to 19 for further trade talks . It was reported on May 20 that Chinese officials had agreed to `` substantially reduce '' America 's trade deficit with China by committing to `` significantly increase '' its purchases of American goods . As a result , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that `` We are putting the trade war on hold '' . White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro , however , said that there was no `` trade war , '' but that it was a `` trade dispute , fair and simple . We lost the trade war long ago . '' </P> <P> The White House announced on May 29 that it would impose a 25 % tariff on $50 billion of Chinese goods with `` industrially significant technology ; '' the full list of products affected to be announced by June 15 . It also planned to impose investment restrictions and enhanced export controls on certain Chinese individuals and organizations to prevent them from acquiring U.S. technology . China said it would discontinue trade talks with Washington if it imposed trade sanctions . '' </P> <P> On June 15 , Trump declared in a short White House statement that the United States would impose a 25 % tariff on $50 billion of Chinese exports . $34 billion would start July 6 , with a further $16 billion to begin at a later date . China 's Commerce Ministry accused the United States of launching a trade war and said China would respond in kind with similar tariffs for US imports , starting on July 6 . Three days later , the White House declared that the United States would impose additional 10 % tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports if China retaliated against these U.S. tariffs . The list of products included in this round of tariffs was released on July 11 and was set to be implemented within 60 days . </P> <P> China retaliated almost immediately , threatening its own tariffs on $50 billion of U.S. goods , and claimed the United States had `` launched a trade war . '' Import and export markets in a number of nations feared the tariffs would disrupt supply chains which could `` ripple around the globe . '' </P> <P> American tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods came into effect on July 6 , 2018 . China imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods of a similar value . The tariffs accounted for 0.1 % of the global gross domestic product . On July 10 , U.S. released an initial list of the additional $200 billion of Chinese goods that would be subject to a 10 % tariff . China vowed to retaliate with additional tariffs on American goods worth $60 billion annually two days later . </P> <P> On August 8 the Office of the United States Trade Representative published its finalized list of 279 Chinese goods , worth $16 Billion , to be subject to a 25 % tariff from August 23 . China responded with its own tariffs of equal value when the American tariffs were implemented on August 23 . </P> <P> On August 14 China filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , claiming that US tariffs on foreign solar panels clash with WTO ruling and have destabilized the international market for solar PV products . China claimed the resulting impact directly harmed China 's legitimate trade interests . </P> <P> US Treasury Under Secretary David Malpass and Chinese Commerce Vice Minister Wang Shouwen met on August 22 in Washington DC in a bid to open up dialogue in response to the intensifying trade war , yet discussions ended with no resolution . By August 23 , US implemented a further 25 % of tariffs on $16 billion of goods as promised , which was reciprocated by China . China filed a new WTO complaint against the US as a result of this tariff escalation . </P> <P> On September 17 the US announced its 10 % tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would begin on September 24 , increasing to 25 % by the end of the year . They also threatened tariffs on an additional $267 billion worth of imports if China retaliates , which China promptly did on September 18 with 10 % tariffs on $60 billion of US imports . So far , China has either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion of U.S. goods , representing most of its imports of American products . </P> <H2> Rationales given for the tariffs ( edit ) </H2> <P> During a campaign speech in June 2016 , President Trump vowed to cancel international trade deals and go on an offensive against Chinese economic practices , describing his promise as a reaction against `` a leadership class that worships globalism . '' In April 2018 , Trump denied that the dispute was actually a trade war , saying `` that war was lost many years ago by the foolish , or incompetent , people who represented the U.S. '' He added : `` Now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year , with intellectual property ( IP ) theft of another $300 billion . We can not let this continue . '' </P> <P> In January 2018 , Trump said he wanted the United States to have a good relationship with China , but insisted that it treat the United States fairly . In his State of the Union Address a few weeks later , he stated : </P> <P> America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies , our jobs , and our Nation 's wealth . The era of economic surrender is over . From now on , we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal . We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones . And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property , through strong enforcement of our trade rules . </P> <P> A number of government and industry experts have offered their own rationales about why the tariffs are , or are not , appropriate : </P> <P> John Ferriola , the CEO and President of Nucor , America 's largest steel producer and its largest metal recycler , claimed that tariffs were not unfair , but were `` simply leveling the playing field . '' He explained to TV host Jim Cramer , that not only the `` European Union , but most countries in the world , have a 25 percent or greater VAT , value - added tax , on products going into their countries from the United States . So if we impose a 25 percent tariff , all we are doing is treating them exactly as they treat us . '' VAT ( value added tax ) is a sales tax which is charged regardless of origin . </P> <P> Analyst Zachary Karabell claimed that the administration 's desire to reject long - standing trade consensus in favor of a more nationalist approach will not succeed : `` A set of very public and punitive tariffs will not reverse what has already been transferred and will not do much to address the challenge of China today , which is no longer a manufacturing neophyte . '' </P> <P> Peter Navarro , White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director , gave a number of the administration 's explanations for the tariffs , among them are that they are `` purely defensive measures . '' He claims that the cumulative trillions of dollars Americans transfer overseas as a result of yearly deficits , are then used by those countries to buy America 's assets , as opposed to investing that money in the U.S. `` If we do as we 're doing ... those trillions of dollars are in the hands of foreigners that they can then use to buy up America . '' </P> <P> Richard Trumka , president of the AFL - CIO , which represents over 12 million active and retired workers , said that China has stolen U.S. intellectual property and `` bullied its way into acquiring critical U.S. advances in technology . '' He stated in March 2018 that `` Tariffs are n't an end goal , but an important tool to end trade practices that kill American jobs and drive down American pay . '' </P> <P> A number of experts have focused on what they consider China 's `` theft '' of intellectual property , and that it forces U.S. firms that want to do business there into transferring its confidential technology and trade secrets before having access to their market . Although that kind of transfer is disallowed by the WTO , the negotiations are usually conducted in secret to avoid penalties . In 2018 the American Chamber of Commerce in China learned that over half its members thought that `` leakage of intellectual property '' was an important concern when doing business there . Similarly , the EU Chamber of Commerce has also complained that European companies wanting access to the Chinese market often had to agree to transfer vital technology . </P> <P> U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , after a seven - month investigation into China and intellectual property , explained that the value of the tariffs imposed was based on U.S. estimates of the actual economic damage caused by China 's alleged IP theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese companies . In response , Chinese Premier Li Keqiang promised in March 2018 to henceforth protect the rights of foreigners investing in its economy , followed in April by an announcement by China that it would eliminate laws that required global automakers and shipbuilders to work through state - owned partners . </P> <P> Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping reiterated those pledges , affirming a desire to increase imports , lower foreign - ownership limits on manufacturing and expand protection to intellectual property , all central issues in Trump 's complaints about their trade imbalance . Trump thanked Xi for his `` kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers '' and `` his enlightenment '' on intellectual property and technology transfers . `` We will make great progress together ! '' the president added . </P> <P> National security experts say Chinese hackers have consistently stolen trade secrets from U.S. defense contractors . This prompted former National Security Agency head Keith Alexander to describe Beijing 's practices as `` the greatest transfer of wealth in history . '' He states : </P> <P> Chinese spies have gone after private defense contractors and subcontractors , national laboratories , public research universities , think tanks and the American government itself . Chinese agents have gone after the United States ' most significant weapons , such as the F - 35 Lightning , the Aegis Combat System and the Patriot missile system ; illegally exported unmanned underwater vehicles and thermal - imaging cameras ; and stolen documents related to the B - 52 bomber , the Delta IV rocket , the F - 15 fighter and even the Space Shuttle . President Trump 's action on Monday acknowledges the broad scope of the challenge . </P> <P> In August 2018 , U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said that `` at the end of the day , we have many more bullets than they do . They know it . '' </P> <H2> Other measures ( edit ) </H2> <P> On October 17 , 2018 , the United States announced their withdrawal from the Universal Postal Union , in order to renegotiate international shipping rates for mail and small postal packages . China had been paying lower rates because it was considered a developing nation ; the United States seek to charge the same rates for all countries . The withdrawal can be rescinded if an agreement is found within one year . </P> <H2> Reactions ( edit ) </H2> <P> U.S. commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said that the planned Chinese tariffs only reflected 0.3 % of U.S. gross domestic product , and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated that the moves would have `` short - term pain '' but bring `` long - term success '' . Nucor 's John Ferriola said that even with the tariffs on steel , the cost of an average $36,000 car would go up about $160 , less than 1 / 2 of 1 % , while a can of beer would only cost an extra penny more . </P> <P> After president Trump imposed tariffs against a number of allies , including Mexico , Canada and countries in the EU , G7 finance leaders strongly condemned the tariffs and planned retaliating with tariffs of their own . </P> <P> By early July 2018 , there were negative and positive results already showing up in the economy as a result of the tariffs , with a number of industries showing employment growth while others were planning on layoffs . </P> <H3> Markets ( edit ) </H3> <P> In anticipation of tariffs going into effect , stock prices in the U.S. and China sustained significant losses for four to six weeks prior . Trade war fears had led to a bear market in China where by late June the total value of the country 's stock markets was 20 % lower than it had been at the beginning of 2018 when it reached record levels . The Japanese Nikkei also suffered a `` three - week pullback '' . On July 6 , when the tariffs went into effect , markets rebounded and rallied due to positive jobs report in the U.S. Asian markets similarly rebounded , ending the day in a high note . According to the Associated Press , the positive reaction to the tariffs in U.S. and Asian markets was because of an end to uncertainty and , according to Investor 's Business Daily , because `` markets had largely priced in the impact '' . </P> <H3> Industry associations ( edit ) </H3> <P> Following announcements of escalation of tariffs by the U.S. and China , representatives of several major U.S. industries expressed their fears of the effects on their businesses . Organizations critical of the intensifying trade war included National Pork Producers Council , American Soybean Association , and Retail Industry Leaders Association . Several mayors representing towns with a heavy reliance on the manufacturing sector also expressed their concerns . In September , a business coalition announced a lobbying campaign called `` Tariffs Hurt the Heartland '' to protest the proposed tariffs . </P> <P> Proponents of the increased U.S. tariffs included Scott Paul , president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing . </P> <H3> Potential impact ( edit ) </H3> <P> A simulation conducted by the Guangdong University of Foreign Studies ' Research Center for International Trade and Economics and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ' Institute of World Economics and Politics measured the potential implications of a trade war between the United States and China . By using a multi-country global general equilibrium model , the simulations produced numerical values that represent the effects of a US - China trade war . Overall , the results indicate that China `` will be significantly hurt by tariff trade war in all indicators , including welfare , gross domestic product ( GDP ) , manufacturing employment and trade . '' However , it is pointed out that although there will be definite impacts on China , the costs should be maintainable and will not severely damage the Chinese economy . In regard to the United States , the simulation produced results that described , `` the US will gain on welfare , GDP and non-manufacturing production , but hurt employment and trade ( both export and import ) . '' Since each nation maintains a large economy , their actions not only effect each other but also the entire world . As a result of the trade war , the simulation predicts that the rest of the world will also see impacts within their own economies . For most large and developed nations , they will see positive benefits from a US - China trade war . As trade decreases between the United States and China , trade will presumably increase between other nations as a result . However , smaller nations will see significant negative impacts . For example , `` World total welfare , GDP , manufacturing production and employment , export , import , and total trade '' are expected to decrease since many of these nations are highly trade dependent . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> United States - China relations </Li> <Li> Cold War II </Li> <Li> Death by China / The Coming China Wars </Li> <Li> Congressional - Executive Commission on China / United States - China Economic and Security Review Commission / Cox Report </Li> <Li> Chinese espionage in the United States / List of Chinese spy cases in the United States / Chinese intelligence activity abroad / Criticism of Confucius Institutes # Espionage <Ul> <Li> Cyberwarfare in China / Chinese Information Operations and Information Warfare / People 's Liberation Army Strategic Support Force / PLA Unit 61398 / PLA Unit 61486 / Honker Union / Red Hacker Alliance / GhostNet </Li> <Li> Office of Personnel Management data breach / Supermicro # Claim of Chinese hardware manufacturing breach / Titan Rain / Night Dragon Operation / Operation Shady RAT / Operation Aurora / Yahoo ! data breaches / Death of Shane Todd </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Non-tariff barriers to trade <Ul> <Li> Censorship in China / Internet censorship in China / Great Firewall / Silenced : China 's Great Wall of Censorship / Radio jamming in China / Mass surveillance in China / Censorship in Hong Kong </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Counterfeit consumer goods / Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement / TRIPS Agreement / Shanzhai <Ul> <Li> PROTECT IP Act / Stop Online Piracy Act </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> First 100 days of Donald Trump 's presidency / Economic policy of Donald Trump / Trump tariffs / Foreign policy of Donald Trump </Li> <Li> Protectionism in the United States / Smoot -- Hawley Tariff Act ( 1930 ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` U.S. files complaint over China 's patent policies '' .

      "    \"long_answer\": \"<P> US President Donald Trump had promised in his campaign to fix China 's `` longtime abuse of the broken international system and unfair practices '' . The United States of America filed a request for consultation to the World Trade Organization , in regard to concerns that the People 's Republic of China was violating intellectual property rights . The U.S. administration is relying partly on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to prevent what it claims are unfair trade practices and theft of intellectual property . This gives the president the authority to unilaterally impose fines or other penalties on a trading partner if it is deemed to be unfairly harming U.S. business interests . Trump had already , in August 2017 , opened a formal investigation into attacks on the intellectual property of the U.S. and its allies , which cost the U.S. alone an estimated $225 -- 600 billion a year . As a result of the findings of the US Trade Representative Section 301 Investigation into China , the United States claims that China enforces laws that allow them to legally avoid certain terms previously laid out by The Agreement on Trade - Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ( TRIPS ) . In summary , the United States believes that certain Chinese laws counteract intellectual property rights by forcing foreign companies to engage in joint ventures with Chinese companies , in which their new Chinese partners are granted access and permission to use , improve , or replicate their technologies . In addition , the United States argues that China is not compliant in recognizing legitimate patents and that their policies discriminate against foreign imported technology . Aside from the United States , several other nations have filed requests for consultation in regard to suspicions of Chinese violations , such as the European Union , Japan , Saudi Arabia , and Ukraine . </P>\",\n",

Prior to the series beginning , the show 's return was advertised with a trailer that borrowed the over-excited responses of the parents of a young boy who were watching the Top Gear team filming the Motorhome challenge , from a clip that was originally published on YouTube . Following its conclusion , it was subsequently followed by two `` Best Of Top Gear '' specials , charting the best moments from the series . </P> <P> This series was Ben Collins ' final one as The Stig , as following a legal dispute with him in the latter half of August 2010 over his autobiography , The Man in the White Suit , the BBC decided not to renew his contract with the show . The series also saw the Chevrolet Lacetti being retired and replaced by a Kia Cee 'd , leading to the Celebrity Lap Board being cleared for the times made in the new car . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Episodes <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Best - of episodes </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Track Day YouTube Clips </Li> <Li> 3 Criticism and Controversy <Ul> <Li> 3.1 `` Woman wearing Burka '' comment </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Top Gear episodes <Table> <Tr> <Th> Total </Th> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Reviews </Th> <Th> Features / challenges </Th> <Th> Guest ( s ) </Th> <Th> Original air date </Th> <Th> UK viewers ( million ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 119 </Th> <Td> 1 </Td> <Td> Series 15 , Episode 1 </Td> <Td> Bentley Continental Supersports </Td> <Td> Toyota Hilux Invincible up an Icelandic volcano Farewell to the former reasonably priced car , the Chevrolet Lacetti Why Reliant went out of business : 1994 Reliant Robin </Td> <Td> Nick Robinson Al Murray Peter Jones Peta 23 from Essex Johnny Vaughan Bill Bailey Louie Spence Amy Williams </Td> <Td> 27 June 2010 ( 2010 - 06 - 27 ) </Td> <Td> 5.60 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"8\\\"> Top Gear is back and the presenters are trying to be sensible . Of course , that 's not the case when Clarkson goes to the North to try to drive a Reliant Robin from Sheffield to Rotherham , and rolling it over in the process , while on the track he road - tests the heavy Bentley Continental Supersports . Elsewhere , May heads to Iceland to see if can give glory to the Toyota Hilux used by the camera crew during the Polar Special , by modifying it for the task of driving close to the Eyjafjallaj\\u00f6kull volcano as it erupts and collect a piece of lava , while Hammond retires the old reasonably priced car -- the Chevrolet Lacetti -- with a `` Viking burial '' , before assisting Clarkson with a summer BBQ for the guests they have invited to the test track to set a lap in the new car -- a Kia Cee 'd . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 120 </Th> <Td> 2 </Td> <Td> Series 15 , Episode 2 </Td> <Td> Porsche 911 Sport Classic Porsche Boxster Spyder </Td> <Td> Find a \\u00a3 5,000 everyday second - hand sports saloon for track days ( Mercedes - Benz 190E 2.3 - 16 Cosworth BMW M3 Ford Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth ) </Td> <Td> Alastair Campbell </Td> <Td> 4 July 2010 ( 2010 - 07 - 04 ) </Td> <Td> 6.60 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"8\\\"> <P> The trio are in Germany , and have bought some second - hand four - door saloons within a budget of \\u00a3 5,000 , to see which is the best choice for the ultimate track day car - May believes it is the Mercedes - Benz 190E 2.3 - 16 Cosworth he bought , Hammond attempts to prove it is his BMW M3 he got , and Clarkson settles on seeing if he can convince the other two that it is his Ford Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth that he purchased . After meeting up in Berlin , the trio travel across the country and test their cars in a series of challenges , including seeing how fast they can drive them on an Autobahn , escorting a brass band in their cars , subject them to a comprehensive road - worthiness test by the ADAC , before finally heading to the EuroSpeedway Lausitz and riding with the Stig 's German cousin as he attempts to do a fast lap with their car , and seeing how many views they got when they filmed themselves doing a lap of the circuit before uploading their video to YouTube . Elsewhere , May tests out the Porsche 911 Sport Classic and the Porsche Boxster Spyder on the track , while former Director of Communications under Tony Blair , Alastair Campbell , is the latest star in the Kia Cee 'd . </P> Note : Due to time constraints , a challenge from the ' Ultimate Second - Hand Track Car ' film was not shown in the episode . The challenge saw the presenters perform an economy run , filling up their cars with precisely 3 imperial gallons ( 14 L ) and seeing if they could drive out of Colditz Germany into the nearest border , which the boys believed to be Poland , with that amount and nothing else ( even though the nearest border is Czech Republic , former Czechoslovakia ) . The cut segment of the film can be seen online . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 121 </Th> <Td> 3 </Td> <Td> Series 15 , Episode 3 </Td> <Td> Chevrolet Camaro SS Mercedes - Benz E63 AMG </Td> <Td> Find the greatest four - door supercar by driving wedding guests : ( Maserati Quattroporte GTS Aston Martin Rapide Porsche Panamera Turbo ) </Td> <Td> Rupert Grint Rubens Barrichello </Td> <Td> 11 July 2010 ( 2010 - 07 - 11 ) </Td> <Td> 4.58 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"8\\\"> <P> Businessmen will certainly want a good four - door saloon car for driving , so the boys see if they can help to find one -- May believes it is the rather good - looking Maserati Quattroporte GTS , despite it being a little fiddly and complicated , Hammond thinks it is the beautiful Aston Martin Rapide , despite it being too expensive , while Clarkson is unsure his choice of the Porsche Panamera Turbo is right , because it is ugly ( in the trio 's eyes ) . Starting in London , the presenters try out their cars , before stopping at a business park and letting the Stig see how fast they are on an improvised course . To fully decide which is best , the trio give them the ultimate test by chauffeuring members of a wedding party to the church and then to the reception , although the boys get a little distracted . Elsewhere , Hammond tests out two new muscles , the Mercedes - Benz E63 AMG and the fifth - generation Chevrolet Camaro , while British actor , Rupert Grint , is the latest star in the new reasonably priced car . </P> Note : The wedding party featured in the ' Best Business Saloon Car ' film were a genuine party ; both the bride and groom got married during filming of the segment , and appeared in the studio where they received a gift of a custom toilet seat for allowing the presenters to chauffeur them . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 122 </Th> <Td> 4 </Td> <Td> Series 15 , Episode 4 </Td> <Td> Audi R8 V10 Spyder Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet </Td> <Td> Building motorhomes ( Lotus Excel Land Rover 110 Citro\\u00ebn CX ) </Td> <Td> Andy Garc\\u00eda Lauren McAvoy </Td> <Td> 18 July 2010 ( 2010 - 07 - 18 ) </Td> <Td> 7.05 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"8\\\"> The presenters wonder if they can make the campervan `` cool '' again , and so set to work at coming up with their very own design from a used car , with the only requirements they need to meet being that it is equipped with sleeping accommodations , cooking facilities , and a `` bog '' - Hammond makes his from a Land Rover 110 that he designs to be `` expandable '' like American motorhomes , Clarkson creates a three - story campervan out of a Citro\\u00ebn CX which he thinks is a genius design , and May sets a shuttle - shaped skybox on top of a Lotus Excel with an `` escape chute '' that leads inside the car . To see how good their creations are , the trio drive to a campsite in Cornwall to see how they fare on the road , set themselves up for the night , take to a beach in the morning where they get surfing lessons , cook in them with ingredients they can find at a local gas station , before finally driving to a local beauty spot where one of the boys ' creations undergoes an `` accident '' . Meanwhile , Clarkson is on the track to review the Audi R8 V10 Spyder and the Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet and puts them through an unusual test , while Hollywood actor , Andy Garc\\u00eda , sees if he can set a fast lap in the Kia . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 123 </Th> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> Series 15 , Episode 5 </Td> <Td> Volkswagen Touareg Bugatti Veyron Super Sport </Td> <Td> Volkswagen Touareg vs Swedish snowmobilers Reach 258mph ( 415 km / h ) in the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport Commemorating racing driver Ayrton Senna , Lewis Hamilton drives Senna 's 1988 F1 racing car . </Td> <Td> Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz </Td> <Td> 25 July 2010 ( 2010 - 07 - 25 ) </Td> <Td> 7.48 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"8\\\"> <P> Hammond heads to Riksgr\\u00e4nsen to see what improvements have been made to the Volkswagen Touareg since Top Gear reviewed the last one , before driving a customised Touareg in a race against snowmobile racers Dan Lang and Daniel Bodin . Meanwhile , May returns to the Ehra - Lessien test track with the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport , an updated version of the Bugatti Veyron , to see if it can reclaim the crown of the `` Fastest Production Car in the World '' by attempting to reach an even faster speed than before , while actors Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise are promoting their new movie Knight and Day while seeing who was faster in the Kia when they did a lap of the Test Track . Finally , Clarkson pays tribute to the late Ayrton Senna , who would have been celebrating his 50th birthday ( at the time the episode was first broadcast ) , by finding out from the people who knew him best - Mika H\\u00e4kkinen , Lewis Hamilton , Jarno Trulli , Martin Brundle , Fernando Alonso , Felipe Massa , Rubens Barrichello , David Coulthard , Mark Webber , Nigel Mansell , and Michael Schumacher -- what he was like on and off the track , before Lewis Hamilton has a go at driving Senna 's F1 car . </P> Note : Because of licensing reasons , the ' Ayrton Senna Tribute ' film has not been shown since it was first aired ; all repeats of this episode end after the ' Star in a Reasonably Priced Car ' segment and go straight to the credits . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 124 </Th> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> Series 15 , Episode 6 </Td> <Td> Ferrari 458 Italia </Td> <Td> Old British roadsters for \\u00a3 5,000 : ( TVR S2 Lotus Elan Jensen - Healey ) </Td> <Td> Jeff Goldblum </Td> <Td> 1 August 2010 ( 2010 - 08 - 01 ) </Td> <Td> 6.19 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"8\\\"> <P> Clarkson , Hammond and May feel that classic British sports cars are much better than European Hot Hatchbacks , so the producers task them with proving this correct by each buying one and testing them in a series of challenges - Clarkson seeks to prove his Jensen - Healey he bought will be good , May buys a TVR S2 to show the producers they were right , and Hammond purchases a Lotus M100 Elan to take on this task . On a journey to the sites of the factories where each car were built , the presenters each try to achieve a fast lap in their car , perform a ' safety test ' , see how waterproof their cars are , and visit a garden centre to find something to fit in their cars . Elsewhere , Clarkson reviews the new Ferrari 458 Italia on the track , while Hollywood actor , Jeff Goldblum , is on the track to drive fast in the Kia Cee 'd . </P> Note : This was Ben Collins ' final appearance as The Stig ; he was axed from the show after the BBC decided to not renew his contract , following a legal dispute between the two parties over Collins ' autobiography . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Best - of episodes ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Total </Th> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Feature </Th> <Th> Original air date </Th> <Th> UK viewers ( million ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> S22 </Th> <Td> CE - 1 </Td> <Td> `` The Best Of Top Gear : 2010 No. 1 '' </Td> <Td> Best Moments from Series 15 - Part 1 </Td> <Td> 8 August 2010 ( 2010 - 08 - 08 ) </Td> <Td> 3.56 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"6\\\"> A look back at some of the best moments from Series 15 , including the race between a Volkswagen Touareg and some Snowmobilers , and Clarkson 's drive to Rotherham in a Reliant Robin . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> S23 </Th> <Td> CE - 2 </Td> <Td> `` The Best Of Top Gear : 2010 No. 2 '' </Td> <Td> Best Moments from Series 15 - Part 2 </Td> <Td> 15 August 2010 ( 2010 - 08 - 15 ) </Td> <Td> 2.55 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"6\\\"> A second look back at the best moments from Series 15 , including the search for the best four - door saloon , and May 's attempt to drive close to an erupting volcano in Iceland . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Track day YouTube clips ( edit ) </H2> <P> During the second episode of Series 15 , the presenters were tasked with finding a second - hand sports saloon that would be perfect for track days . The challenge of this task was for each presenter to film themselves doing a lap of the EuroSpeedway Lausitz 's circuit and posting the completed film onto YouTube . Each presenters individual video was not shown completely on the show , but the full length , unedited videos can be viewed online via the links below : </P> <Ul> <Li> Sierra Cosworth hot lap - Jeremy Clarkson 's ( CossieMan2000 ) lap in his Ford Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth . </Li> <Li> M3 lap - Richard Hammond 's ( MrM3MAN ) `` lap '' in his BMW E36 M3 . </Li> <Li> A lap of the Euro Speedway in my Mercedes - Benz 190E 2.3 - 16 - James May 's ( Mercedes1902316 ) lap in his Mercedes - Benz 190E 2.3 - 16 Cosworth . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Criticism and controversy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> `` Woman wearing burka '' comment ( edit ) </H3> <P> During the News segment of the fifth episode , Clarkson got into a discussion with Hammond , in which he joked that he had been in cab the other day and truly seen a woman wearing a burka tripping up on a pavement , upon which he could see that under it she was wearing a `` red g - string and stockings '' . Following the broadcast of the episode , the BBC received a number of complaints regarding the joke , with the singer Lily Allen writing on Twitter that the joke was `` distasteful '' , while a Mediawatch spokesperson said that Clarkson `` should learn to keep quiet '' . Prior to the joke being aired , a debate had been ongoing over the use of the burka ; Faeeza Vaid , co-ordinator of the Muslim Women 's Network UK , criticised the joke , saying : </P> <P> `` The debate surrounding the burka is a serious issue which should n't be publicly joked about . Rather than joking about it , we should be having serious dialogue . '' </P> <P> However , in an article written for The Week , Antonia Bland defended the presenter 's joke , saying that Clarkson had done nothing wrong and that Muslim women who wore a burka had the right to `` choose to wear gorgeous lingerie in private '' , adding that the joke proved a good example of the dangers faced by male drivers trying to concentrate on the road during Summer . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <P> The viewing figures shown in the Episode Table above ( with the exception of the first episode ) , are a combination of the figures from the BBC Two broadcast and the BBC HD broadcast . </P> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ 6.00 million on BBC Two , 602,000 on BBC HD . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ 4.03 million on BBC Two , 549,000 on BBC HD . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ 6.47 million on BBC Two , 575,000 on BBC HD . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ 6.65 million on BBC Two , 827,000 on BBC HD . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ 5.81 million on BBC Two , 379,000 on BBC HD . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Top Gear - Season 15 trailer '' .

CAD systems and graphical user interfaces ( GUI ) allow the user to control and provide data to the computer using physical gestures by moving a hand - held mouse or similar device across the surface of the physical desktop and activating switches on the mouse . Movements of the pointing device are echoed on the screen by movements of the pointer ( or cursor ) and other visual changes . Common gestures are point and click and drag and drop . </P> <P> While the most common pointing device by far is the mouse , many more devices have been developed .

An indirect - input pointing device is not at the same physical position as the pointer but translates its movement onto the screen ( e.g. , computer mouse , joystick , stylus on a graphics tablet ) . </P> <Ul> <Li> absolute vs. relative movement </Li> </Ul> <P> An absolute - movement input device ( e.g. , stylus , finger on touch screen ) provides a consistent mapping between a point in the input space ( location / state of the input device ) and a point in the output space ( position of pointer on screen ) . A relative - movement input device ( e.g. , mouse , joystick ) maps displacement in the input space to displacement in the output state . It therefore controls the relative position of the cursor compared to its initial position . </P> <Ul> <Li> isotonic vs. elastic vs. isometric </Li> </Ul> <P> An isotonic pointing device is movable and measures its displacement ( mouse , pen , human arm ) whereas an isometric device is fixed and measures the force which acts on it ( trackpoint , force - sensing touch screen ) . An elastic device increases its force resistance with displacement ( joystick ) . </P> <Ul> <Li> position control vs. rate control </Li> </Ul> <P> A position - control input device ( e.g. , mouse , finger on touch screen ) directly changes the absolute or relative position of the on - screen pointer . A rate - control input device ( e.g. , trackpoint , joystick ) changes the speed and direction of the movement of the on - screen pointer . </P> <Ul> <Li> translation vs. rotation </Li> </Ul> <P> Another classification is the differentiation between whether the device is physically translated or rotated . </P> <Ul> <Li> degrees of freedom </Li> </Ul> <P> Different pointing devices have different degrees of freedom ( DOF ) . A computer mouse has two degrees of freedom , namely its movement on the x - and y - axis . However the Wiimote has 6 degrees of freedom : x - , y - and z - axis for movement as well as for rotation . </P> <Ul> <Li> possible states </Li> </Ul> <P> As mentioned later in this article , pointing devices have different possible states . Examples for these states are out of range , tracking or dragging . </P> <P> Examples </P> <Ul> <Li> a computer mouse is an indirect , relative , isotonic , position - control , translational input device with two degrees of freedom and </Li> </Ul> <P> three states . </P> <Ul> <Li> a touch screen is a direct , absolute , isometric , position - control input device with two degrees of freedom and </Li> </Ul> <P> two states . </P> <Ul> <Li> a joystick is an indirect , relative , elastic , rate - control , translational input device with two degrees of freedom and </Li> </Ul> <P> two states . </P> <Ul> <Li> a Wiimote is an indirect , relative , elastic , rate - control , translational input device with six degrees of freedom and </Li> </Ul> <P> two states . </P> <H2> Buxton 's taxonomy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following table shows a classification of pointing devices by their number of dimensions ( columns ) and which property is sensed ( rows ) introduced by Bill Buxton . The sub-rows distinguish between mechanical intermediary ( i.e. stylus ) ( M ) and touch - sensitive ( T ) . It is rooted in the human motor / sensory system . Continuous manual input devices are categorized . Sub-columns distinguish devices that use comparable motor control for their operation . The table is based on the original graphic of Bill Buxton 's work on `` Taxonomies of Input '' . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th_colspan=\\\"9\\\"> Number of Dimensions </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> 1 </Th> <Th_colspan=\\\"4\\\"> 2 </Th> <Th_colspan=\\\"1\\\"> 3 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Property Sensed </Th> <Th> Position </Th> <Td> Rotary Pot </Td> <Td> Sliding Pot </Td> <Td> Tablet & Puck </Td> <Td> Tablet & Stylus </Td> <Td> Light Pen </Td> <Td> Floating Joystick </Td> <Td> 3D Joystick </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Touch Tablet </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Touch Screen </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> T </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Motion </Th> <Td> Continuous Rotary Pot </Td> <Td> Treadmill </Td> <Td> Mouse </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Trackball </Td> <Td> 3D Trackball </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Ferinstat </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> X / Y Pad </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> T </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Pressure </Th> <Td> Torque Sensor </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Isometric Joystick </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> T </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Buxton 's three - state - model ( edit ) </H2> <P> This model describes different states that a pointing device can assume . The three common states as described by Buxton are out of range , tracking and dragging . Not every pointing device can switch to all states . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Model </Th> <Th> Explanation </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 State Transaction </Td> <Td> A mouse is moved without the button being pushed . This state can be called tracking , meaning the user just moves the mouse without further interacting with the system . If the mouse is pointed at an icon and the button is pressed while moving the mouse , a new state called dragging is entered . These states are shown in the image `` 2 State Transaction '' . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Out of Range & Tracking </Td> <Td> If a touch tablet , which is able to sense touch or no - touch , is used instead of a mouse , the state model looks different . More precisely this means that any movement of the finger off the display is out of range and has no effect on the system . Only when the finger touches the display , the state switches to tracking ( Figure : `` Out of Range & Tracking '' ) . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Out of Range , Tracking & Dragging </Td> <Td> If a graphics tablet with a stylus is used , it is possible to sense all three states . When the stylus is lifted , it is out of range . When it is in range , the state switches to tracking and the pointer follows the stylus ' movement . Performing extra pressure on the stylus initiates state 2 dragging ( Figure : `` Out of Range , Tracking & Dragging '' ) . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> State 2 Set </Td> <Td> By using a multiple - button mouse or multiple clicks , State 2 can be split into a set of states , i.e. pressing different buttons leads to different states . For example , selecting an object with Button 1 switches to the state Drag Original whereas Button 2 switches to Drag Copy . The same goes for multiple clicks known from Windows : one click on an object selects an object , double - clicks open it ( Figure : `` State 2 Set '' ) . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Fitts ' law ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Fitts ' Law <P> Fitts 's law ( often cited as Fitts ' law ) is a predictive model of human movement primarily used in human -- computer interaction and ergonomics . This scientific law predicts that the time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the ratio between the distance to the target and the width of the target . Fitts 's law is used to model the act of pointing , either by physically touching an object with a hand or finger , or virtually , by pointing to an object on a computer monitor using a pointing device . In other words , this means for example , that the user needs more time to click on a small button which is distant to the cursor , than he needs to click a large button near the cursor . Thereby it is generally possible to predict the speed which is needed for a selective movement to a certain target . </P> <H3> Mathematical formulation ( edit ) </H3> <P> The common metric to calculate the average time to complete the movement is the following : </P> <Dl> <Dd> MT = a + b \\u22c5 ID = a + b \\u22c5 log 2 \\u2061 ( 2 D W ) ( \\\\ displaystyle ( \\\\ text ( MT ) ) = a + b \\\\ cdot ( \\\\ text ( ID ) ) = a + b \\\\ cdot \\\\ log _ ( 2 ) ( \\\\ Bigg ( ) ( \\\\ frac ( 2D ) ( W ) ) ( \\\\ Bigg ) ) ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> where : </P> <Ul> <Li> MT is the average time to complete the movement . </Li> <Li> a and b are constants that depend on the choice of input device and are usually determined empirically by regression analysis . </Li> <Li> ID is the index of difficulty . </Li> <Li> D is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target . </Li> <Li> W is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion . W can also be thought of as the allowed error tolerance in the final position , since the final point of the motion must fall within \\u00b1 \\u200b \\u2044 of the target 's center . </Li> </Ul> <P> This results in the interpretation that , as mentioned before , large and close targets can be reached faster than little , distant targets . </P> <H3> Applying Fitts ' law in user interface design ( edit ) </H3> <P> As mentioned above , the size and distance of an object influence its selection . Additionally this effects the user experience . Therefore , it is important , that Fitts ' Law is considered while designing user interfaces . Below some basic principles are mentioned . </P> <Ul> <Li> Interactive elements </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> Command buttons for example should have different sizes than non-interactive elements . Larger interactive objects are easier to select with any pointing device . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Edges and corners </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> Due to the fact , that the cursor gets pinned on the edges and corners of a graphical user interface , those points can be accessed faster than other spots on the display . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Pop - up menus </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> They should support immediate selection of interactive elements in order to reduce the user 's `` travel time '' . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Options for selecting </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> Within menus like dropdown menus or top - level navigation , the distance increases the further the user goes down the list . However in pie menus , the distance to the different buttons is always the same . In addition , the target areas in pie menus are larger . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Task bars </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> To operate a task bar , the user needs a higher level of precision , thus more time . Generally they hinder the movement through the interface . </Dd> </Dl> <H2> Control - display gain ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Control - Display Gain ( or CD gain ) describes the proportion between movements in the control space to the movements in the display space . For example , a hardware mouse moves in another speed or distance than the cursor on the screen . Even if these movements take place in two different spaces , the units for measurement have to be the same in order to be meaningful ( e.g. meters instead of pixels ) . The CD gain refers to the scale factor of these two movements : </P> <Dl> <Dd> C D g a i n = V D i s p l a y / V C o n t r o l ( \\\\ displaystyle CDgain = V_ ( Display ) / V_ ( Control ) ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> The CD gain settings can be adjusted in most cases . However , a compromise has to be found : with high gains it is easier to approach a distant target , with low gains this takes longer . High gains hinder the selection of targets , whereas low gains facilitate this process . The operating systems Microsoft Windows , Apple OS X and Xorg have implemented mechanisms in order to adapt the CD gain to the user 's needs , e.g. the CD gain increases when the user 's movement velocity increases . </P> <H2> Common pointing devices ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Motion - tracking pointing devices ( edit ) </H3> Mouse ( edit ) Main article : Mouse ( computing ) <P> A mouse is a small handheld device pushed over a horizontal surface . </P> <P> A mouse moves the graphical pointer by being slid across a smooth surface . The conventional roller - ball mouse uses a ball to create this action : the ball is in contact with two small shafts that are set at right angles to each other . As the ball moves these shafts rotate , and the rotation is measured by sensors within the mouse . The distance and direction information from the sensors is then transmitted to the computer , and the computer moves the graphical pointer on the screen by following the movements of the mouse . Another common mouse is the optical mouse . This device is very similar to the conventional mouse but uses visible or infrared light instead of a roller - ball to detect the changes in position . Additionally there is the mini-mouse , which is a small egg - sized mouse for use with laptop computers ; usually small enough for use on a free area of the laptop body itself , it is typically optical , includes a retractable cord and uses a USB port to save battery life . </P> Trackball ( edit ) Main article : Trackball <P> A trackball is a pointing device consisting of a ball housed in a socket containing sensors to detect rotation of the ball about two axis , similar to an upside - down mouse : as the user rolls the ball with a thumb , fingers , or palm the pointer on the screen will also move . Tracker balls are commonly used on CAD workstations for ease of use , where there may be no desk space on which to use a mouse . Some are able to clip onto the side of the keyboard and have buttons with the same functionality as mouse buttons . There are also wireless trackballs which offer a wider range of ergonomic positions to the user . </P> Joystick ( edit ) Main article : Joystick <P> Isotonic joysticks are handle sticks where the user can freely change the position of the stick , with more or less constant force . </P> <P> Isometric joysticks are where the user controls the stick by varying the amount of force they push with , and the position of the stick remains more or less constant . Isometric joysticks are often cited as more difficult to use due to the lack of tactile feedback provided by an actual moving joystick . </P> See also : Analog stick Pointing stick ( edit ) Main article : Pointing stick <P> A pointing stick is a pressure - sensitive small nub used like a joystick . It is usually found on laptops embedded between the G , H , and B keys . It operates by sensing the force applied by the user . The corresponding `` mouse '' buttons are commonly placed just below the space bar . It is also found on mice and some desktop keyboards . </P> Wiimote ( edit ) Main article : Wiimote <P> The Wii Remote , also known colloquially as the Wiimote , is the primary controller for Nintendo 's Wii console . A main feature of the Wii Remote is its motion sensing capability , which allows the user to interact with and manipulate items on screen via gesture recognition and pointing through the use of accelerometer and optical sensor technology . </P> Finger tracking ( edit ) <P> A finger tracking device tracks fingers in the 3D space or close to the surface without contact with a screen . Fingers are triangulated by technologies like stereo camera , time - of - flight and laser . Good examples of finger tracking pointing devices are LM3LABS ' Ubiq'window and AirStrike </P> <H3> Position - tracking pointing devices ( edit ) </H3> Graphics tablet ( edit ) Main article : Graphics tablet A graphics tablet with a pen <P> A graphics tablet or digitizing tablet is a special tablet similar to a touchpad , but controlled with a pen or stylus that is held and used like a normal pen or pencil . The thumb usually controls the clicking via a two - way button on the top of the pen , or by tapping on the tablet 's surface . </P> <P> A cursor ( also called a puck ) is similar to a mouse , except that it has a window with cross hairs for pinpoint placement , and it can have as many as 16 buttons . A pen ( also called a stylus ) looks like a simple ballpoint pen but uses an electronic head instead of ink . The tablet contains electronics that enable it to detect movement of the cursor or pen and translate the movements into digital signals that it sends to the computer . '' This is different from a mouse because each point on the tablet represents a point on the screen . </P> Stylus ( edit ) Main article : Stylus ( computing ) A smartphone being operated with a stylus <P> A stylus is a small pen - shaped instrument that is used to input commands to a computer screen , mobile device or graphics tablet . </P> <P> The stylus is the primary input device for personal digital assistants and smartphones that require accurate input , although devices featuring multi-touch finger - input with capacitive touchscreens are becoming more popular than stylus - driven devices in the smartphone market . </P> Touchpad ( edit ) Trackpad on an Apple MacBook Pro <P> A touchpad or trackpad is a flat surface that can detect finger contact . It is a stationary pointing device , commonly used on laptop computers . At least one physical button normally comes with the touchpad , but the user can also generate a mouse click by tapping on the pad . Advanced features include pressure sensitivity and special gestures such as scrolling by moving one 's finger along an edge . </P> <P> It uses a two - layer grid of electrodes to measure finger movement : one layer has vertical electrode strips that handle vertical movement , and the other layer has horizontal electrode strips to handle horizontal movements . </P> Touchscreen ( edit ) A virtual keyboard on an iPad <P> A touchscreen is a device embedded into the screen of the TV monitor , or system LCD monitor screens of laptop computers . Users interact with the device by physically pressing items shown on the screen , either with their fingers or some helping tool . </P> <P> Several technologies can be used to detect touch . Resistive and capacitive touchscreens have conductive materials embedded in the glass and detect the position of the touch by measuring changes in electric current . Infrared controllers project a grid of infrared beams inserted into the frame surrounding the monitor screen itself , and detect where an object intercepts the beams . </P> <P> Modern touchscreens could be used in conjunction with stylus pointing devices , while those powered by infrared do not require physical touch , but just recognize the movement of hand and fingers in some minimum range distance from the real screen . </P> <P> Touchscreens are becoming popular with the introduction of palmtop computers like those sold by the Palm , Inc. hardware manufacturer , some high range classes of laptop computers , mobile smartphone like HTC or the Apple Inc. iPhone , and the availability of standard touchscreen device drivers into the Symbian , Palm OS , Mac OS X , and Microsoft Windows operating systems . </P> <H3> Pressure - tracking pointing devices ( edit ) </H3> Isometric joystick ( edit ) <P> In contrast to a 3D Joystick , the stick itself does n't move or just moves very little and is mounted in the device chassis . To move the pointer , the user has to apply force to the stick . Typical representatives can be found on notebook 's keyboards between the `` G '' and `` H '' keys . By performing pressure on the TrackPoint , the cursor moves on the display . </P> <H2> Other devices ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> A light pen is a device similar to a touch screen , but uses a special light - sensitive pen instead of the finger , which allows for more accurate screen input . As the tip of the light pen makes contact with the screen , it sends a signal back to the computer containing the coordinates of the pixels at that point . It can be used to draw on the computer screen or make menu selections , and does not require a special touch screen because it can work with any CRT display . </Li> <Li> Light gun </Li> <Li> Palm mouse -- held in the palm and operated with only two buttons ; the movements across the screen correspond to a feather touch , and pressure increases the speed of movement </Li> <Li> Footmouse -- sometimes called a mole -- a mouse variant for those who do not wish to or can not use the hands or the head ; instead , it provides footclicks </Li> <Li> Similar to a mouse is a puck , which , rather than tracking the speed of the device , tracks the absolute position of a point on the device ( typically a set of crosshairs painted on a transparent plastic tab sticking out from the top of the puck ) . Pucks are typically used for tracing in CAD / CAM / CAE work , and are often accessories for larger graphics tablets . </Li> <Li> Eye tracking devices -- a mouse controlled by the user 's retinal movements , allowing cursor - manipulation without touch </Li> <Li> Finger - mouse -- An extremely small mouse controlled by two fingers only ; the user can hold it in any position </Li> <Li> Gyroscopic mouse -- a gyroscope senses the movement of the mouse as it moves through the air . Users can operate a gyroscopic mouse when they have no room for a regular mouse or must give commands while standing up . This input device needs no cleaning and can have many extra buttons , in fact , some laptops doubling as TVs come with gyroscopic mice that resemble , and double as , remotes with LCD screens built in . </Li> <Li> Steering wheel -- can be thought of as a 1D pointing device -- see also steering wheel section of game controller article </Li> <Li> Paddle -- another 1D pointing device </Li> <Li> Jog dial -- another 1D pointing device </Li> <Li> Yoke ( aircraft ) </Li> <Li> Some high - degree - of - freedom input devices </Li> <Li> Spaceball -- six - degree controller </Li> <Li> Discrete pointing devices </Li> <Li> directional pad -- a very simple keyboard </Li> <Li> Dance pad -- used to point at gross locations in space with feet </Li> <Li> Soap mouse -- a handheld , position - based pointing device based on existing wireless optical mouse technology </Li> <Li> Laser pen -- can be used in presentations as a pointing device </Li> <Li> RollerMouse - The RollerMouse is equipped with a rollerbar that rolls and glides to navigate the screen cursor and perform standard left - click functions when depressed . Can be used in a variety of work settings , and is ergonomically designed to maintain healthy posture of hand , wrist , elbow , and shoulder joints . The RollerMouse is often cited as a `` central pointing device '' , as it sits directly in front of the keyboard and bisects the users body midline . </Li> </Ul> <P> This article is based on material taken from the Free On - line Dictionary of Computing prior to 1 November 2008 and incorporated under the `` relicensing '' terms of the GFDL , version 1.3 or later . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to Pointing device . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Zhai , S.

Written and Directed by Mark Herman , produced by BBC Films and Heyday Films , and distributed by Miramax , the film stars Vera Farmiga , David Thewlis , Asa Butterfield , and Jack Scanlon . It was released on 12 September 2008 in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> The Holocaust drama relates the horror of a World War II Nazi extermination camp through the eyes of two 8 - year - old boys ; Bruno ( Asa Butterfield ) , the son of the camp 's Nazi commandant , and Shmuel ( Jack Scanlon ) , a Jewish inmate . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Reception <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Critical response </Li> <Li> 3.2 Accolades </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film opens with the quote `` Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights , before the dark hour of reason grows '' , by John Betjeman . A young boy named Bruno lives with his family in Berlin , in Nazi Germany during World War II . He learns that his father Ralf has been promoted , due to which their family , including Bruno 's mother Elsa and sister Gretel , relocate to the `` countryside '' ( occupied Poland ) . Bruno hates his new home as there is no one to play with and very little to explore . After commenting that he has spotted people working on what he thinks is a farm in the distance ( but , unbeknownst to the innocent Bruno , is actually a concentration camp ) , he is also forbidden from playing in the back garden . </P> <P> Bruno and Gretel get a private tutor , Herr Liszt , who pushes an agenda of antisemitism and nationalist propaganda . As a result , Gretel becomes extremely fanatical in her support for the Third Reich , to the point of covering her bedroom wall with Nazi propaganda posters and portraits of Adolf Hitler . Bruno is confused as the Jews he has seen , in particular the family 's Jewish servant Pavel , do not resemble the caricatures in Liszt 's teachings . </P> <P> One day , Bruno disobeys his parents and sneaks off into the woods , eventually arriving at an electric barbed wire fence surrounding a camp . He befriends a boy his own age named Shmuel . The pair 's lack of knowledge on the true nature of the camp is revealed : Bruno thinks that the striped uniforms that Shmuel , Pavel , and the other prisoners wear are pyjamas and Shmuel believes his grandparents died from an illness during their journey to the camp . Bruno starts meeting Shmuel regularly , sneaking him food and playing board games with him . He eventually learns that Shmuel is a Jew and was brought to the camp with his father and mother . </P> Prisoner 's clothing from Sachsenhausen concentration camp <P> One day , Elsa discovers the reality of Ralf 's assignment after Lieutenant Kurt Kotler lets slip that the black smoke coming from the camp 's chimneys is due to the burning corpses of Jews . She confronts Ralf , disgusted and heartbroken . At dinner that night , Kotler admits that his father had left his family and moved to Switzerland . Upon hearing this , Ralf tells Kotler that he should have informed the authorities of his father 's disagreement with the current political regime as it was his duty . The embarrassed Kotler then becomes infuriated with Pavel for accidentally spilling a glass of wine and violently beats him . The next morning the maid , Maria , is seen scrubbing the blood stains . </P> <P> Later that day , Bruno sees Shmuel working in his home . Shmuel is there to clean wine glasses because they needed someone with small hands to do it . Bruno offers him some cake and willingly Shmuel accepts it . Unfortunately , Kotler happens to walk into the room where Bruno and Shmuel are socialising . Kotler is furious and yells at Shmuel for talking to Bruno . In the midst of his scolding , Kotler notices Shmuel chewing the food Bruno gave him . When Kotler asks Shmuel where he got the food , he says Bruno offered the cake , but Bruno , fearful of Kotler , denies this . Believing Bruno , Kotler tells Shmuel that they will have a `` little chat '' later . Distraught , Bruno goes to apologise to Shmuel , but finds him gone . Every day , Bruno returns to the same spot by the camp but does not see Shmuel . Eventually , Shmuel reappears behind the fence , sporting a black eye . Bruno apologises and Shmuel forgives him , renewing the friendship . </P> <P> After the funeral of his grandmother who was killed in Berlin by an Allied bombing , Ralf tells Bruno and Gretel that Elsa , their mother , suggests that they go to live with a relative because it is not safe there . In truth , Elsa suggests this because she does not want her children living with their murderous father . Shmuel has problems of his own ; his father has gone missing after those with whom he participated in a march did not return to the camp . Bruno decides to redeem himself by helping Shmuel find his father . The next day , Bruno , who is due to leave that afternoon , dons a striped prisoners ' outfit and a cap to cover his unshaven head , and digs under the fence to join Shmuel in the search . Bruno soon discovers the true nature of the camp after seeing the many sick and weak - looking Jews , much to his shock . While searching , the boys are taken on a march with other inmates by Sonderkommandos . </P> <P> At the house , Gretel and Elsa discover Bruno 's disappearance . After they discover the open window he went through , Elsa bursts into Ralf 's meeting to alert him that Bruno is missing . Ralf and his men mount a search . Led by a dog tracking Bruno 's scent they find his discarded clothing outside the fence . Elsa and Gretel are following along behind . They enter the camp , looking for him ; Bruno , Shmuel and the other inmates are stopped inside a changing room and are told to remove their clothes for a `` shower '' . They are packed into a gas chamber , where Bruno and Shmuel hold each other 's hands . A Schutzstaffel soldier pours some Zyklon B pellets inside , and the prisoners start panicking , yelling and banging on the metal door . When Ralf realises that a gassing is taking place , he cries out his son 's name , and Elsa and Gretel fall to their knees in despair and mourn Bruno . The film ends by showing the closed door of the now - silent gas chamber , indicating that all prisoners , including Bruno and Shmuel , are dead . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Asa Butterfield as Bruno </Li> <Li> Jack Scanlon as Shmuel , a young Jew sent to a concentration camp </Li> <Li> Vera Farmiga as Elsa , Bruno 's mother </Li> <Li> David Thewlis as Ralf , Bruno 's father </Li> <Li> Amber Beattie as Gretel , Bruno 's older sister </Li> <Li> Rupert Friend as Lieutenant Kurt Kotler </Li> <Li> David Hayman as Pavel </Li> <Li> Sheila Hancock as Natalie , Bruno 's grandmother </Li> <Li> Richard Johnson as Matthias , Bruno 's grandfather </Li> <Li> Cara Horgan as Maria </Li> <Li> Jim Norton as Herr Liszt </Li> </Ul> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas has a 63 % approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , based on 135 reviews , with an average rating of 6.2 / 10 .

This article is about the natural process . For artificial gene transfer , see Gene delivery . A type of nonhereditary genetic change involving swapping of DNA or RNA Tree of life showing vertical and horizontal gene transfers <P> Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) or lateral gene transfer ( LGT ) is the movement of genetic material between unicellular and / or multicellular organisms other than by the ( `` vertical '' ) transmission of DNA from parent to offspring ( reproduction ) . HGT is an important factor in the evolution of many organisms . </P> <P> Horizontal gene transfer is the primary mechanism for the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria , and plays an important role in the evolution of bacteria that can degrade novel compounds such as human - created pesticides and in the evolution , maintenance , and transmission of virulence . It often involves temperate bacteriophages and plasmids . Genes responsible for antibiotic resistance in one species of bacteria can be transferred to another species of bacteria through various mechanisms of HGT such as transformation , transduction and conjugation , subsequently arming the antibiotic resistant genes ' recipient against antibiotics . The rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes in this manner is becoming medically challenging to deal with . It is also postulated that HGT promotes the maintenance of a universal life biochemistry and , subsequently , the universality of the genetic code . </P> <P> Most thinking in genetics has focused upon vertical transfer , but the importance of horizontal gene transfer among single - cell organisms is beginning to be acknowledged . </P> <P> Gene delivery can be seen as an artificial horizontal gene transfer , and is a form of genetic engineering . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Mechanisms <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Horizontal transposon transfer </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Methods of detection </Li> <Li> 4 Viruses </Li> <Li> 5 Prokaryotes <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Bacterial transformation </Li> <Li> 5.2 Bacterial conjugation </Li> <Li> 5.3 Archaeal DNA transfer </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Eukaryotes <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Organelle to nuclear genome </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bacteria to fungi </Li> <Li> 6.3 Bacteria to plants </Li> <Li> 6.4 Endosymbiont to insects and nematodes </Li> <Li> 6.5 Organelle to organelle </Li> <Li> 6.6 Plant to plant </Li> <Li> 6.7 Fungi to insects </Li> <Li> 6.8 Human to protozoan </Li> <Li> 6.9 Bacteria to insects </Li> <Li> 6.10 Viruses to plants </Li> <Li> 6.11 Human genome </Li> <Li> 6.12 Bacteria to animals </Li> <Li> 6.13 Plants to animals </Li> <Li> 6.14 Plant - fungus </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Artificial horizontal gene transfer </Li> <Li> 8 Importance in evolution <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Challenge to the tree of life </Li> <Li> 8.2 Phylogenetic information in HGT </Li> <Li> 8.3 The chromosomal organization of Horizontal Gene Transfer </Li> <Li> 8.4 Genes </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 Sources and notes </Li> <Li> 11 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Griffith 's experiment , reported in 1928 by Frederick Griffith , was the first experiment suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation . Griffith 's findings were followed by research in the late 1930s and early 40s that isolated DNA as the material that communicated this genetic information . </P> <P> Horizontal genetic transfer was then described in Seattle in 1951 , in a paper demonstrating that the transfer of a viral gene into Corynebacterium diphtheriae created a virulent strain from a non-virulent strain , also simultaneously solving the riddle of diphtheria ( that patients could be infected with the bacteria but not have any symptoms , and then suddenly convert later or never ) , and giving the first example for the relevance of the lysogenic cycle . Inter-bacterial gene transfer was first described in Japan in a 1959 publication that demonstrated the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different species of bacteria . In the mid-1980s , Syvanen predicted that lateral gene transfer existed , had biological significance , and was involved in shaping evolutionary history from the beginning of life on Earth . </P> <P> As Jian , Rivera and Lake ( 1999 ) put it : `` Increasingly , studies of genes and genomes are indicating that considerable horizontal transfer has occurred between prokaryotes '' ( see also Lake and Rivera , 2007 ) . The phenomenon appears to have had some significance for unicellular eukaryotes as well . As Bapteste et al. ( 2005 ) observe , `` additional evidence suggests that gene transfer might also be an important evolutionary mechanism in protist evolution . '' </P> <P> Grafting of one plant to another can transfer chloroplasts ( organelles in plant cells that conduct photosynthesis ) , mitochondrial DNA , and the entire cell nucleus containing the genome to potentially make a new species . Some Lepidoptera ( e.g. monarch butterflies and silkworms ) have been genetically modified by horizontal gene transfer from the wasp bracovirus . Bites from the insect Reduviidae ( assassin bug ) can , via a parasite , infect humans with the trypanosomal Chagas disease , which can insert its DNA into the human genome . It has been suggested that lateral gene transfer to humans from bacteria may play a role in cancer . </P> <P> Aaron Richardson and Jeffrey D. Palmer state : `` Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) has played a major role in bacterial evolution and is fairly common in certain unicellular eukaryotes . However , the prevalence and importance of HGT in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes remain unclear . '' </P> <P> Due to the increasing amount of evidence suggesting the importance of these phenomena for evolution ( see below ) molecular biologists such as Peter Gogarten have described horizontal gene transfer as `` A New Paradigm for Biology '' . </P> <H2> Mechanisms ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are several mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer : </P> <Ul> <Li> Transformation , the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the introduction , uptake and expression of foreign genetic material ( DNA or RNA ) . This process is relatively common in bacteria , but less so in eukaryotes . Transformation is often used in laboratories to insert novel genes into bacteria for experiments or for industrial or medical applications . See also molecular biology and biotechnology . </Li> <Li> Transduction , the process in which bacterial DNA is moved from one bacterium to another by a virus ( a bacteriophage , or phage ) . </Li> <Li> Bacterial conjugation , a process that involves the transfer of DNA via a plasmid from a donor cell to a recombinant recipient cell during cell - to - cell contact . </Li> <Li> Gene transfer agents , virus - like elements encoded by the host that are found in the alphaproteobacteria order Rhodobacterales . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Horizontal transposon transfer ( edit ) </H3> <P> A transposable element ( TE ) ( also called a transposon or jumping gene ) is a mobile segment of DNA that can sometimes pick up a resistance gene and insert it into a plasmid or chromosome , thereby inducing horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance . </P> <P> Horizontal transposon transfer ( HTT ) refers to the passage of pieces of DNA that are characterized by their ability to move from one locus to another between genomes by means other than parent - to - offspring inheritance . Horizontal gene transfer has long been thought to be crucial to prokaryotic evolution , but there is a growing amount of data showing that HTT is a common and widespread phenomenon in eukaryote evolution as well . On the transposable element side , spreading between genomes via horizontal transfer may be viewed as a strategy to escape purging due to purifying selection , mutational decay and / or host defense mechanisms . </P> <P> HTT can occur with any type of transposable elements , but DNA transposons and LTR retroelements are more likely to be capable of HTT because both have a stable , double - stranded DNA intermediate that is thought to be sturdier than the single - stranded RNA intermediate of non-LTR retroelements , which can be highly degradable . Non-autonomous elements may be less likely to transfer horizontally compared to autonomous elements because they do not encode the proteins required for their own mobilization . The structure of these non-autonomous elements generally consists of an intronless gene encoding a transposase protein , and may or may not have a promoter sequence . Those that do not have promoter sequences encoded within the mobile region rely on adjacent host promoters for expression . Horizontal transfer is thought to play an important role in the TE life cycle . </P> <P> HTT has been shown to occur between species and across continents in both plants and animals ( Ivancevic et al. 2013 ) , though some TEs have been shown to more successfully colonize the genomes of certain species over others . Both spatial and taxonomic proximity of species has been proposed to favor HTTs in plants and animals . It is unknown how the density of a population may affect the rate of HTT events within a population , but close proximity due to parasitism and cross contamination due to crowding have been proposed to favor HTT in both plants and animals . Successful transfer of a transposable element requires delivery of DNA from donor to host cell ( and to the germ line for multi-cellular organisms ) , followed by integration into the recipient host genome . Though the actual mechanism for the transportation of TEs from donor cells to host cells is unknown , it is established that naked DNA and RNA can circulate in bodily fluid . Many proposed vectors include arthropods , viruses , freshwater snails ( Ivancevic et al. 2013 ) , endosymbiotic bacteria , and intracellular parasitic bacteria . In some cases , even TEs facilitate transport for other TEs . </P> <P> The arrival of a new TE in a host genome can have detrimental consequences because TE mobility may induce mutation . However , HTT can also be beneficial by introducing new genetic material into a genome and promoting the shuffling of genes and TE domains among hosts , which can be co-opted by the host genome to perform new functions . Moreover , transposition activity increases the TE copy number and generates chromosomal rearrangement hotspots . HTT detection is a difficult task because it is an ongoing phenomenon that is constantly changing in frequency of occurrence and composition of TEs inside host genomes . Furthermore , few species have been analyzed for HTT , making it difficult to establish patterns of HTT events between species . These issues can lead to the underestimation or overestimation of HTT events between ancestral and current eukaryotic species . </P> <H2> Methods of detection ( edit ) </H2> A speciation event produces orthologs of a gene in the two daughter species . A horizontal gene transfer event from one species to another adds a xenolog of the gene to the receiving genome . Main article : Inferring horizontal gene transfer <P> Horizontal gene transfer is typically inferred using bioinformatics methods , either by identifying atypical sequence signatures ( `` parametric '' methods ) or by identifying strong discrepancies between the evolutionary history of particular sequences compared to that of their hosts . The transferred gene ( xenolog ) found in the receiving species is more closely related to the genes of the donor species than would be expected . </P> <H2> Viruses ( edit ) </H2> <P> The virus called Mimivirus infects amoebae . Another virus , called Sputnik , also infects amoebae , but it can not reproduce unless mimivirus has already infected the same cell . `` Sputnik 's genome reveals further insight into its biology . Although 13 of its genes show little similarity to any other known genes , three are closely related to mimivirus and mamavirus genes , perhaps cannibalized by the tiny virus as it packaged up particles sometime in its history . This suggests that the satellite virus could perform horizontal gene transfer between viruses , paralleling the way that bacteriophages ferry genes between bacteria . '' Horizontal transfer is also seen between geminiviruses and tobacco plants . </P> <H2> Prokaryotes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Horizontal gene transfer is common among bacteria , even among very distantly related ones . This process is thought to be a significant cause of increased drug resistance when one bacterial cell acquires resistance , and the resistance genes are transferred to other species . Transposition and horizontal gene transfer , along with strong natural selective forces have led to multi-drug resistant strains of S. aureus and many other pathogenic bacteria . Horizontal gene transfer also plays a role in the spread of virulence factors , such as exotoxins and exoenzymes , amongst bacteria . A prime example concerning the spread of exotoxins is the adaptive evolution of Shiga toxins in E. coli through horizontal gene transfer via transduction with Shigella species of bacteria . Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these specific virulence factors and mobile genetic elements have been proposed . For example , horizontally transferred genetic elements play important roles in the virulence of E. coli , Salmonella , Streptococcus and Clostridium perfringens . </P> <P> In prokaryotes , restriction - modification systems are known to provide immunity against horizontal gene transfer and in stabilizing mobile genetic elements . Genes encoding restriction modification systems have been reported to move between prokaryotic genomes within mobile genetic elements such as plasmids , prophages , insertion sequences / transposons , integrative conjugative elements ( ICEs ) , and integrons . Still , they are more frequently a chromosomal - encoded barrier to MGEs than an MGE - encoded tool for cell infection . </P> <H3> Bacterial transformation ( edit ) </H3> 1 : Donor bacteria 2 : Bacteria who will receive the gene 3 : The red portion represents the gene that will be transferred . Transformation in bacteria in a certain environment . <P> Natural transformation is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer ( HGT ) that depends on the expression of numerous bacterial genes whose products are responsible for this process . In general , transformation is a complex , energy - requiring developmental process . In order for a bacterium to bind , take up and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome , it must become competent , that is , enter a special physiological state . Competence development in Bacillus subtilis requires expression of about 40 genes . The DNA integrated into the host chromosome is usually ( but with infrequent exceptions ) derived from another bacterium of the same species , and is thus homologous to the resident chromosome . The capacity for natural transformation occurs in at least 67 prokaryotic species . Competence for transformation is typically induced by high cell density and / or nutritional limitation , conditions associated with the stationary phase of bacterial growth . Competence appears to be an adaptation for DNA repair . Transformation in bacteria can be viewed as a primitive sexual process , since it involves interaction of homologous DNA from two individuals to form recombinant DNA that is passed on to succeeding generations . Although transduction is the form of HGT most commonly associated with bacteriophages , certain phages may also be able to promote transformation . </P> <H3> Bacterial conjugation ( edit ) </H3> 1 : Donor bacteria cell ( F+ cell ) 2 : Bacteria that receives the plasmid ( F - cell ) 3 : Plasmid that will be moved to the other bacteria 4 : Pilus . Conjugation in bacteria using a sex pilus ; then the bacteria that received the plasmid can go give it to other bacteria as well . <P> Conjugation in Mycobacterium smegmatis , like conjugation in E. coli , requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain , is DNase resistant , and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination . However , unlike E. coli high frequency of recombination conjugation ( Hfr ) , mycobacterial conjugation is a type of HGT that is chromosome rather than plasmid based . Furthermore , in contrast to E. coli ( Hfr ) conjugation , in M. smegmatis all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies . Substantial blending of the parental genomes was found as a result of conjugation , and this blending was regarded as reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction . </P> <H3> Archaeal DNA transfer ( edit ) </H3> <P> The archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus , when UV irradiated , strongly induces the formation of type IV pili which then facilitates cellular aggregation . Exposure to chemical agents that cause DNA damage also induces cellular aggregation . Other physical stressors , such as temperature shift or pH , do not induce aggregation , suggesting that DNA damage is a specific inducer of cellular aggregation . </P> <P> UV - induced cellular aggregation mediates intercellular chromosomal HGT marker exchange with high frequency , and UV - induced cultures display recombination rates that exceed those of uninduced cultures by as much as three orders of magnitude . S. solfataricus cells aggregate preferentially with other cells of their own species . Frols et al. and Ajon et al. suggested that UV - inducible DNA transfer is likely an important mechanism for providing increased repair of damaged DNA via homologous recombination . This process can be regarded as a simple form of sexual interaction . </P> <P> Another thermophilic species , Sulfolobus acidocaldarius , is able to undergo HGT . S. acidocaldarius can exchange and recombine chromosomal markers at temperatures up to 84 C. UV exposure induces pili formation and cellular aggregation . Cells with the ability to aggregate have greater survival than mutants lacking pili that are unable to aggregate . The frequency of recombination is increased by DNA damage induced by UV - irradiation and by DNA damaging chemicals . </P> <P> The ups operon , containing five genes , is highly induced by UV irradiation . The proteins encoded by the ups operon are employed in UV - induced pili assembly and cellular aggregation leading to intercellular DNA exchange and homologous recombination . Since this system increases the fitness of S. acidocaldarius cells after UV exposure , Wolferen et al. considered that transfer of DNA likely takes place in order to repair UV - induced DNA damages by homologous recombination . </P> <H2> Eukaryotes ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic ' domains ' . Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes . '' </P> <H3> Organelle to nuclear genome ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Analysis of DNA sequences suggests that horizontal gene transfer has occurred within eukaryotes from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to the nuclear genome .

The gene 's functionality is unknown . </Li> <Li> A gene that allowed ferns to survive in dark forests came from the hornwort , which grows in mats on streambanks or trees . The neochrome gene arrived about 180 million years ago . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Fungi to insects ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Pea aphids ( Acyrthosiphon pisum ) contain multiple genes from fungi .

Tardigrades were thought to break the record with 17.5 % HGT , but that finding was an artifact of bacterial contamination . </Li> <Li> A study found the genomes of 40 animals ( including 10 primates , four Caenorhabditis worms , and 12 Drosophila insects ) contained genes which the researchers concluded had been transferred from bacteria and fungi by horizontal gene transfer . The researchers estimated that for some nematodes and Drosophilia insects these genes had been acquired relatively recently . </Li> <Li> A bacteriophage - mediated mechanism transfers genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes . Nuclear localization signals in bacteriophage terminal proteins ( TP ) prime DNA replication and become covalently linked to the viral genome . The role of virus and bacteriophages in HGT in bacteria , suggests that TP - containing genomes could be a vehicle of inter-kingdom genetic information transference all throughout evolution . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Plants to animals ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> The eastern emerald sea slug Elysia chlorotica has been suggested by FISH analysis to contain photosynthesis - supporting genes obtained from an algae ( Vaucheria litorea ) in their diet . LGT in Sacoglossa is now thought to be an artifact and no trace of LGT was found upon sequencing the genome of Elysia chlorotica . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Plant - fungus ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Plant - fungus horizontal gene transfer <P> Gene transfer between plants and fungi has been posited for a number of cases , including rice ( Oryza sativa ) . </P> <H2> Artificial horizontal gene transfer ( edit ) </H2> Before it is transformed , a bacterium is susceptible to antibiotics . A plasmid can be inserted when the bacteria is under stress , and be incorporated into the bacterial DNA creating antibiotic resistance . When the plasmids are prepared they are inserted into the bacterial cell by either making pores in the plasma membrane with temperature extremes and chemical treatments , or making it semi permeable through the process of electrophoresis , in which electric currents create the holes in the membrane . After conditions return to normal the holes in the membrane close and the plasmids are trapped inside the bacteria where they become part of the genetic material and their genes are expressed by the bacteria . <P> Genetic engineering is essentially horizontal gene transfer , albeit with synthetic expression cassettes . The Sleeping Beauty transposon system ( SB ) was developed as a synthetic gene transfer agent that was based on the known abilities of Tc1 / mariner transposons to invade genomes of extremely diverse species . The SB system has been used to introduce genetic sequences into a wide variety of animal genomes . ( See also Gene therapy . ) </P> <H2> Importance in evolution ( edit ) </H2> See also : Horizontal gene transfer in evolution <P> Horizontal gene transfer is a potential confounding factor in inferring phylogenetic trees based on the sequence of one gene . For example , given two distantly related bacteria that have exchanged a gene a phylogenetic tree including those species will show them to be closely related because that gene is the same even though most other genes are dissimilar . For this reason it is often ideal to use other information to infer robust phylogenies such as the presence or absence of genes or , more commonly , to include as wide a range of genes for phylogenetic analysis as possible . </P> <P> For example , the most common gene to be used for constructing phylogenetic relationships in prokaryotes is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene since its sequences tend to be conserved among members with close phylogenetic distances , but variable enough that differences can be measured . However , in recent years it has also been argued that 16s rRNA genes can also be horizontally transferred . Although this may be infrequent , the validity of 16s rRNA - constructed phylogenetic trees must be reevaluated . </P> <P> Biologist Johann Peter Gogarten suggests `` the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research '' therefore `` biologists should use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use the metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes '' . There exist several methods to infer such phylogenetic networks . </P> <P> Using single genes as phylogenetic markers , it is difficult to trace organismal phylogeny in the presence of horizontal gene transfer . Combining the simple coalescence model of cladogenesis with rare HGT horizontal gene transfer events suggest there was no single most recent common ancestor that contained all of the genes ancestral to those shared among the three domains of life . Each contemporary molecule has its own history and traces back to an individual molecule cenancestor . However , these molecular ancestors were likely to be present in different organisms at different times . '' </P> <H3> Challenge to the tree of life ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Last universal common ancestor and tree of life ( science ) <P> Horizontal gene transfer poses a possible challenge to the concept of the last universal common ancestor ( LUCA ) at the root of the tree of life first formulated by Carl Woese , which led him to propose the Archaea as a third domain of life . Indeed , it was while examining the new three - domain view of life that horizontal gene transfer arose as a complicating issue : Archaeoglobus fulgidus was seen as an anomaly with respect to a phylogenetic tree based upon the encoding for the enzyme HMGCoA reductase -- the organism in question is a definite Archaean , with all the cell lipids and transcription machinery that are expected of an Archaean , but whose HMGCoA genes are of bacterial origin . Scientists are broadly agreed on symbiogenesis , that mitochondria in eukaryotes derived from alpha - proteobacterial cells and that chloroplasts came from ingested cyanobacteria , and other gene transfers may have affected early eukaryotes . ( In contrast , multicellular eukaryotes have mechanisms to prevent horizontal gene transfer , including separated germ cells . ) If there had been continued and extensive gene transfer , there would be a complex network with many ancestors , instead of a tree of life with sharply delineated lineages leading back to a LUCA . However , a LUCA can be identified , so horizontal transfers must have been relatively limited . </P> <H3> Phylogenetic information in HGT ( edit ) </H3> <P> On the opposite , it has been remarked that the detection of Horizontal Gene Transfers could bring valuable phylogenetic and dating information . </P> <P> The potential of HGT to be used for dating phylogenies has recently been confirmed . </P> <H3> The chromosomal organization of horizontal gene transfer ( edit ) </H3> <P> The acquisition of new genes has the potential to disorganize the other genetic elements and hinder the function of the bacterial cell , thus affecting the competitiveness of bacteria . Consequently , bacterial adaptation lies in a conflict between the advantages of acquiring beneficial genes , and the need to maintain the organization of the rest of its genome . Horizontally transferred genes are typically concentrated in only ~ 1 % of the chromosome ( in regions called hotspots ) . This concentration increases with genome size and with the rate of transfer . Hotspots diversify by rapid gene turnover ; their chromosomal distribution depends on local contexts ( neighboring core genes ) , and content in mobile genetic elements . Hotspots concentrate most changes in gene repertoires , reduce the trade - off between genome diversification and organization , and should be treasure troves of strain - specific adaptive genes . Most mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes are in hotspots , but many hotspots lack recognizable mobile genetic elements and exhibit frequent homologous recombination at flanking core genes . Overrepresentation of hotspots with fewer mobile genetic elements in naturally transformable bacteria suggests that homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer are tightly linked in genome evolution . </P> <H3> Genes ( edit ) </H3> This list is incomplete ; you can help by expanding it . <P> There is evidence for historical horizontal transfer of the following genes : </P> <Ul> <Li> Lycopene cyclase for carotenoid biosynthesis , between Chlorobi and Cyanobacteria . </Li> <Li> TetO gen conferring resistance to tetracycline , between Campylobacter jejuni . </Li> <Li> Neochrome , gene in some ferns that enhances their ability to survive in dim light . Believed to have been acquired from algae sometime during the Cretaceous . </Li> <Li> transfer of a cysteine synthase from a bacterium into phytophagous mites and Lepidoptera allowing the detoxification of cyanogenic glucosides produced by host plants . </Li> <Li> The LINE1 sequence has transferred from humans to the gonorrhea bacteria . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Agrobacterium , a bacterium well known for its ability to transfer DNA between itself and plants . </Li> <Li> Endogenous retrovirus </Li> <Li> Genetically modified organism </Li> <Li> Inferring horizontal gene transfer </Li> <Li> Integron </Li> <Li> Mobile genetic elements </Li> <Li> Phylogenetic network </Li> <Li> Phylogenetic tree </Li> <Li> Provirus </Li> <Li> Reassortment </Li> <Li> Retrotransposon </Li> <Li> Symbiogenesis </Li> <Li> Tree of life ( biology ) </Li> <Li> Xenobiology </Li> </Ul> <H2> Sources and notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Ochman , H. , Lawrence , J.G. , & Groisman , E.A.

      "    \"long_answer\": \"<P> Horizontal gene transfer is the primary mechanism for the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria , and plays an important role in the evolution of bacteria that can degrade novel compounds such as human - created pesticides and in the evolution , maintenance , and transmission of virulence . It often involves temperate bacteriophages and plasmids . Genes responsible for antibiotic resistance in one species of bacteria can be transferred to another species of bacteria through various mechanisms of HGT such as transformation , transduction and conjugation , subsequently arming the antibiotic resistant genes ' recipient against antibiotics . The rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes in this manner is becoming medically challenging to deal with . It is also postulated that HGT promotes the maintenance of a universal life biochemistry and , subsequently , the universality of the genetic code . </P>\",\n",

It initially appeared on Cooke 's album Ai n't That Good News , released March 1 , 1964 by RCA Victor ; a slightly edited version of the recording was released as a single on December 22 , 1964 . Produced by Hugo & Luigi and arranged and conducted by Ren\\u00e9 Hall , the song was the B - side to `` Shake '' . </P> <P> The song was inspired by various personal events in Cooke 's life , most prominently an event in which he and his entourage were turned away from a whites - only motel in Louisiana . Cooke felt compelled to write a song that spoke to his struggle and of those around him , and that pertained to the Civil Rights Movement and African Americans . The song contains the refrain , `` It 's been a long time coming , but I know a change is gon na come . '' </P> <P> Though only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison with his previous singles , `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' is widely considered Cooke 's best composition and has been voted among the best songs ever released by various publications . In 2007 , the song was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress , with the National Recording Registry deeming the song `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically important .

While his brother Charles protested , Sam was fuming , yelling to see the manager and refusing to leave until he received an answer . His wife nudged him , attempting to calm him down , telling him , `` They 'll kill you , '' to which he responded , `` They ai n't gon na kill me , because I 'm Sam Cooke . '' When they eventually persuaded Cooke to leave , the group drove away calling out insults and blaring their horns . When they arrived at the Castle Motel on Sprague Street downtown , the police were waiting for them , arresting them for disturbing the peace . The New York Times ran an AP report the following day headlined `` Negro Band Leader Held in Shreveport , '' but African - Americans were outraged , leading to the creation of a myth surrounding the incident , exaggerating parts of the story and fabricating others . </P> <P> In addition , upon hearing Bob Dylan 's `` Blowin ' in the Wind '' in 1963 , Cooke was greatly moved that such a poignant song about racism in America could come from someone who was not black , and was also ashamed he had not yet written something like that himself . However , his image and fears of losing his largely white fan base prevented him from doing so . Cooke loved the song so much it was immediately incorporated into his repertoire . </P> <H2> Recording and production ( edit ) </H2> <P> Following Christmas 1963 , Cooke invited J.W. Alexander to his home to preview a new song he had just written , one Cooke was very excited about . When he arrived , Cooke ran through the number on his guitar twice , the second time going over it line by line . Both were very excited to record the song , with Alexander viewing it more personal and political than anything he had yet attempted . He warned Cooke that he may not profit off the song as he had with lighter , poppier songs , but Cooke did not care . He explained to Alexander that he hoped the song would make his father proud . `` It was less work than any song he 'd ever written , '' biographer Peter Guralnick says . `` It almost scared him that the song -- it was almost as if the song were intended for somebody else . He grabbed it out of the air and it came to him whole , despite the fact that in many ways it 's probably the most complex song that he wrote . It was both singular -- in the sense that you started out , ' I was born by the river ' -- but it also told the story both of a generation and of a people . '' </P> <P> Cooke handed the song to his arranger Ren\\u00e9 Hall , with no specific instructions as to what he personally wanted , but to give it `` the kind of instrumentation and orchestration that it demanded . '' Previously , the duo had collaborated on arrangement , but this was the first occasion in which Hall was granted complete control of the eventual arrangement , and he composed it as he would a movie score , with lush , symphonic strings . `` I wanted it to be the greatest thing in my ( life ) -- I spent a lot of time , put out a lot of ideas , and then changed them and rearranged them , '' said Hall . Cooke was well known as a perfectionist and `` control freak '' in the recording studio , so giving Hall total latitude was unprecedented . </P> <P> AFO drummer John Boudreaux was intimidated by the orchestral arrangement and refused to leave the control room ; session player and close collaborator Earl Palmer was working next door and filled in for the song . Luigi Creatore asked Cooke to provide one more take , and the eighth take was `` nearly perfect . '' Luigi was very pleased with the song , considering it among his best , both very serious and still uniquely his own . Cooke had initially imagined that Luigi , first and foremost a pop hitmaker , would not respect the socially conscious song . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' A sound sample of `` A Change Is Gonna Come , '' emphasizing the song 's lush , orchestral accompaniment . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Problems playing this file ? See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Each verse is a different movement , with the horns carrying the first , the strings the second , and the timpani carrying the bridge . The French horn present in the recording was intended to convey a sense of melancholy . </P> <P> Cooke incorporated his own personal experiences as well into the song , such as encounters in Memphis , Shreveport and Birmingham , to reflect the lives and struggles of all African - Americans of the time . The lines `` I do n't know what 's up there / Beyond the sky '' could refer to Cooke 's doubt for absolute true justice on earth . The final verse , in which Cooke pleads for his `` brother '' to help him , is a metaphor for what Alexander described as `` the establishment '' The verse continues , ' But he winds up knocking me / back down on my knees . ' '' </P> <H2> Personnel ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' was recorded on January 30 , 1964 , at RCA Studios in Hollywood , California . The engineer present was Wally Heider , and the session was conducted and arranged by Ren\\u00e9 Hall . The musicians also recorded `` Falling in Love '' the same day .

Cooke 's new manager , Allen Klein , was infatuated with the song and persuaded Cooke to do away with promoting his most recent single , `` Ai n't That Good News '' , and perform `` Change '' instead , feeling that that was the statement he needed to make before a national audience . Cooke objected , noting that the album 's release was a month away and that he had no time to pull together an arrangement within such a short time frame . Klein arranged for RCA to pay for a full string section and Cooke performed the song that Friday on The Tonight Show after performing `` Basin Street '' . An NBC timekeeper logged down the number as `` It 's a Long Time Coming , '' but the network did not save the tape of the performance . Klein and Alexander both felt it would become a milestone moment in Cooke 's career , but it was overshadowed by the Beatles ' performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS just two days later . </P> <P> The song was issued on March 1 as a track on Cooke 's album Ai n't That Good News . It would not be issued as a single for another nine months . </P> <P> Cooke elected not to perform `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' again in his lifetime , both because of the complexity of the arrangement and because of the ominous nature of the song . When shown to his prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 Bobby Womack , his response was that it sounds `` like death . '' Cooke responded , `` Man , that 's kind of how it sounds like to me . That 's why I 'm never going to play it in public . '' Womack clarified his thoughts , that it was n't deathly , but rather `` spooky , '' but Cooke never performed the song again . </P> <P> In December , `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' was prepared for single release , with the verse and chorus preceding the bridge ( `` I go to the movies ... '' ) deleted for radio airplay . The civil rights movement picked up on `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' with near immediacy . On December 11 , 1964 , two weeks before the song was released , Sam Cooke was fatally shot at a Los Angeles motel . </P> <P> `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' became an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement , and is widely considered Cooke 's best composition . Over the years , the song has garnered significant praise and , in 2005 , was voted number 12 by representatives of the music industry and press in Rolling Stone magazine 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time , and voted number 3 in the webzine Pitchfork Media 's The 200 Greatest Songs of the 60s . The song is also among three hundred songs deemed the most important ever recorded by National Public Radio ( NPR ) and was recently selected by the Library of Congress as one of twenty - five selected recordings to the National Recording Registry as of March 2007 . The song is currently ranked as the 46th greatest song of all time , as well as the third best song of 1964 , by Acclaimed Music . NPR called the song `` one of the most important songs of the civil rights era . '' </P> <P> Despite its acclaim , legal troubles have haunted the single since its release . A dispute between Cooke 's music publisher , ABKCO , and record company , RCA Records , made the recording unavailable for much of the four decades since its release . Although the song was featured prominently in the 1992 film Malcolm X , it could not be included in the film 's soundtrack . By 2003 , however , the disputes had been settled in time for the song to be included on the remastered version of Ai n't That Good News , as well as the Cooke anthology Portrait of a Legend . </P> <P> A live rendition was included in the soundtrack to the 2001 Michael Mann film Ali . James Taylor recorded a version specially for an episode of the same title of the television drama The West Wing . The Allman Brothers Band captured their performance of the song on their 2003 DVD Live at the Beacon Theatre . </P> <H3> Cover versions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Other notable artists who have covered the song include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Gerald Alston 2008 </Li> <Li> Baby Huey on The Baby Huey Story 1971 </Li> <Li> The Band 1973 </Li> <Li> George Benson 1979 </Li> <Li> Wayne Brady 2008 </Li> <Li> Billy Bragg 2006 </Li> <Li> Brandy </Li> <Li> Solomon Burke 1986 </Li> <Li> John Boutte 2001 </Li> <Li> Tony Carey </Li> <Li> the Cold War Kids 2007 </Li> <Li> Terence Trent D'Arby </Li> <Li> Gavin DeGraw 2003 </Li> <Li> Matt Doyle </Li> <Li> Bob Dylan 1979 </Li> <Li> Everlast 2011 </Li> <Li> The 5th Dimension ( in a 1970 medley with The Rascals ' `` People Got to Be Free '' ) </Li> <Li> Aretha Franklin from `` I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You '' 1967 </Li> <Li> the Fugees 1996 </Li> <Li> Jeffrey Gaines </Li> <Li> The Gits </Li> <Li> Al Green 1996 </Li> <Li> Greta Van Fleet 2017 </Li> <Li> Deitrick Haddon </Li> <Li> Morten Harket </Li> <Li> Beth Hart </Li> <Li> jacksoul 2006 </Li> <Li> Leela James 2005 </Li> <Li> R.

On their album The Reunion hip - hop artists Capone - N - Noreaga used an excerpt from the song on the opening track which shares the same title as the Cooke original . British soul singer Beverley Knight says the song is her all - time favorite and has performed it live many a time ; most notably on ' Later with Jools Holland ' . On May 6 , 2008 , during the seventh season of American Idol , the song was sung by contestant Syesha Mercado as the remaining top 4 . It was also sung by Joshua Ledet during the Top 7 episode of season 11 ( 2012 ) , for which he received a standing ovation from the audience . After winning the 2008 United States presidential election , Barack Obama referred to the song , stating to his supporters in Chicago , `` It 's been a long time coming , but tonight , change has come to America . '' A duet of the song by Bettye LaVette and Jon Bon Jovi was included in We Are One : The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial . In Washington DC , in the days leading up to the Inauguration of Barack Obama , this song could be heard played constantly in the city centre . </P> <P> In 2004 , Patti LaBelle performed the song on the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert to a standing ovation . </P> <P> Julian Casablancas , lead singer of popular rock band The Strokes , has cited `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' as his favorite song of all time . </P> <P> In 2009 , Aaron Neville , along with the Mt . Zion Mass Choir , released a version of the song `` A Change Is Gonna Come '' on the compilation album Oh Happy Day . </P> <P> American Idol creator / producer Simon Fuller selected the song for contestant Adam Lambert to sing in the season 8 finale in May , 2009 . It was also covered by season 9 semifinalist Lilly Scott in March 2010 . </P> <P> In 2010 , one of the finalists of the British The X Factor , Rebecca Ferguson , sang the song for her audition , impressing judges Simon Cowell , Louis Walsh and guest judge Nicole Scherzinger . </P> <P> The song was performed in the 2011 Miss America Pageant by Miss Kentucky , Djuan Trent . </P> <P> In 2011 , jazz group Afro - Blue performed the song on The Sing - off by request of the judges . The same year , Everlast recorded a version of the song for his album Songs of the Ungrateful Living . Maverick Sabre covered the song on his 2012 album Lonely Are the Brave </P> <P> On January 1 , 2012 , the song was the last single to be played on the New Zealand radio station Solid Gold FM before the station rebranded . </P> <P> On June 1 , 2013 Beyonc\\u00e9 Knowles sang the song during The Sound of Change Live concert in London , as part of Chime for Change , an organization which supports total equality between women and men in all areas of life . Mark Sutherland of Rolling Stone magazine noted that Knowles belted out the song , while Alice Vincent from The Daily Telegraph noted that the rendition of the song reflected the event 's purpose . Later , on July 20 , 2013 , Knowles performed the song during a stop in Detroit as part of her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour . The performance followed the city 's recent file for bankruptcy . As Knowles performed , the screen behind her displayed photos of Detroit 's landmarks and icons including Aretha Franklin , Aaliyah , Eminem , Anita Baker , Bob Seger , Kid Rock , The White Stripes , Berry Gordy , Jr , Joe Louis . The montage ended with the declaration `` Nothing Stops Detroit ! '' and Knowles closed the performance by saying `` I love you , Detroit '' . A spokesperson for the singer described the performance as a `` unique tribute to the history of an incredible city and a celebration of the strong spirit of its people '' . A black - and - white video of the cover was uploaded on Knowles ' official YouTube channel on July 30 , 2013 . It closes with a quote from Henry Ford : `` Failure is simply the opportunity to start over , this time more intelligently . '' A reporter for The Huffington Post reported that the singer 's `` heartfelt '' cover of the song `` touched '' her fans and the people who loved Detroit . Latifah Muhammad of the Black Entertainment Television wrote that Knowles ' `` powerful '' rendition of the song came right on time . An editor for Essence described Knowles ' cover as a `` moving tribute to Detroit '' . Jordan Sargent of Spin wrote , `` It all might come off as a bit heavy - handed if it was n't for the fact that , well , Beyonce absolutely slays the cover . '' Lauren Moraski from CBS News described the tribute to the city as `` touching '' . In 2013 15 - year - old Dwayne Cooke released a video of himself singing `` A Change Gonna Come '' on YouTube which has gone viral on Facebook and other social networking sites ... </P> <H2> Other ( edit ) </H2> <P> The words `` A change is gon na come '' are on a wall of the Contemplative Court , a space for reflection in the Smithsonian 's National Museum of African American History and Culture ; the museum opened in 2016 . </P> <H2> Chart history ( Sam Cooke version ) ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1965 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Billboard R&B Singles Chart </Td> <Td> 9 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> 31 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Bibliography ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Portrait of a Legend 1951 - 1964 .

      "    \"long_answer\": \"<P> The song was inspired by various personal events in Cooke 's life , most prominently an event in which he and his entourage were turned away from a whites - only motel in Louisiana . Cooke felt compelled to write a song that spoke to his struggle and of those around him , and that pertained to the Civil Rights Movement and African Americans . The song contains the refrain , `` It 's been a long time coming , but I know a change is gon na come . '' </P>\",\n",

It was released on 19 October 1998 in the United Kingdom by Skint Records and in the United States by Astralwerks . The album was recorded and produced at Cook 's home studio called `` The House of Love '' in Brighton , England . </P> <P> The album was a critical and commercial success , containing four top ten singles . The album peaked at number one on the UK albums chart , number one in New Zealand , number two in Australia , and number thirty - four on the US Billboard 200 . Four singles were released from the album : `` The Rockafeller Skank '' , `` Gangster Tripping '' , `` Praise You '' , and `` Right Here , Right Now '' , each of which reached the top 10 in the UK Singles Chart . `` Build It Up -- Tear It Down '' was also released as a promo , but not as a commercial single . The four singles from the album brought Fatboy Slim an international profile and You 've Come a Long Way , Baby was described as his ' global break - through album ' . Its success earned him a Brit Award in 1999 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Editing </Li> <Li> 2 Title and artwork </Li> <Li> 3 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 4 Track listing </Li> <Li> 5 Personnel </Li> <Li> 6 Charts <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 6.2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Certifications </Li> <Li> 8 Release history </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Editing ( edit ) </H2> <P> You 've Come a Long Way , Baby was recorded entirely using an Atari ST computer , Creator software and floppy disks . The album faced issues regarding the use of profanity , most notably on the track `` Fucking in Heaven '' ( renamed `` In Heaven '' in North America , and `` Illin in Heaven '' on the censored version ) , where the word ' fucking ' is spoken 108 times by Freddy Fresh . The word `` shit '' is used in `` Gangster Tripping '' 57 times , which makes a total of 165 profanities . Because of this , the album was given a Parental Advisory sticker . It is possible that the repeated use of `` druggy '' in `` Kalifornia '' also required the sticker , which is not limited to simply profanity but also to drug references . </P> <H2> Title and artwork ( edit ) </H2> <P> The title You 've Come a Long Way , Baby was derived from a marketing slogan for Virginia Slims cigarettes . Conceived by Red Design , the album 's primary cover art features an obese young man dressed in a T - shirt bearing the words `` I 'm # 1 so why try harder '' while holding a cigarette in his left hand . The original photograph was taken at the 1983 Fat People 's Festival in Danville , Virginia and provided by the Rex Features photo library . Despite a series of enquiries , the man has not been identified . Additional photography for the You 've Come a Long Way , Baby liner notes was provided by Simon Thornton . The cover image was changed in North America to an image of shelves stacked with records . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Professional ratings </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Review scores </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Source </Th> <Th> Rating </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AllMusic </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Encyclopedia of Popular Music </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Entertainment Weekly </Td> <Td> B+ </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Muzik </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> NME </Td> <Td> 8 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Pitchfork </Td> <Td> 8.2 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Q </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Rolling Stone </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Select </Td> <Td> 5 / 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Spin </Td> <Td> 8 / 10 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The album received critical acclaim , particularly for its beats and hooks , and is considered a benchmark album in big beat music .

The system , known officially as the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway for former New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey , is operated by the New York State Thruway Authority ( NYSTA ) , a New York State public - benefit corporation / private corporation , and comprises 569.83 miles ( 917.05 km ) of highway . The tolled mainline of the Thruway extends for 496.00 miles ( 798.23 km ) from the New York City line at Yonkers to the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley by way of Albany , Syracuse , and Buffalo . According to the International Bridge , Tunnel and Turnpike Association , the Thruway is the fifth busiest toll road in the United States . </P> <P> A tolled highway connecting the major cities of New York was first proposed as early as the 1940s . The first section of the Thruway , between Utica and Rochester , opened on June 24 , 1954 . The remainder of the mainline and many of its spurs connecting to highways in other states and provinces were built in the 1950s . In 1957 , much of the Thruway system was included as portions of Interstate 87 ( I - 87 ) , I - 90 , and I - 95 . Other segments became part of I - 190 and I - 287 shortly afterward . Today , the system comprises six highways : the New York -- Ripley mainline , the Berkshire Connector , the Garden State Parkway Connector , the New England Thruway ( I - 95 ) , the Niagara Thruway ( I - 190 ) , and the Cross-Westchester Expressway ( I - 287 ) . The portion of I - 84 in New York was part of the Thruway system from 1991 to 2010 . </P> <P> The Thruway utilizes a combination of open ( barrier - based ) , closed ( ticket - based ) , and all - electronic ( open road ) tolling . Tickets are used on the Thruway mainline between Harriman and Williamsville and from Lackawanna to the Pennsylvania state line . The Berkshire Connector also utilizes a ticket - based tolling system . The portion of the mainline south of Harriman and the New England Thruway have open tolling systems , with both highways containing at least one toll barrier . The Niagara Thruway and the Tappan Zee Bridge use all electronic tolls , with tolls paid using either E-ZPass or Tolls - By - Mail . The last two components -- the Garden State Parkway Connector and the Cross-Westchester Expressway -- and the section of the mainline in and around Buffalo are toll - free . A proposed transition to cashless tolls would eliminate all toll booths and their operators by 2020 . The thruway is partly subsidized by the tolls , whereas other parts are subsidized by NYDOT , a 50 / 50 for the toll - free areas , and cashless / tolled areas </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Organization </Li> <Li> 2 Route description <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Mainline <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 South of Albany </Li> <Li> 2.1. 2 Albany to Syracuse </Li> <Li> 2.1. 3 Syracuse to Buffalo </Li> <Li> 2.1. 4 West of Buffalo </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 Berkshire Connector </Li> <Li> 2.3 Garden State Parkway Connector </Li> <Li> 2.4 Other components </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 History <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Origins and construction </Li> <Li> 3.2 System expansion </Li> <Li> 3.3 Toll elimination and I - 84 </Li> <Li> 3.4 Other developments </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Services <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Travel plazas </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Tolls <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Collection methods </Li> <Li> 5.2 Cost </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Exit list <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Mainline </Li> <Li> 6.2 Berkshire Connector </Li> <Li> 6.3 Garden State Parkway Connector </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Organization ( edit ) </H2> <P> In August 2017 , Matthew J. Driscoll was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo as the Acting Executive Director . The executive officers report to a 6 - member board of directors . In 2017 , it had operating expenses of $872.17 million , an outstanding debt of $8.827 billion , and a staffing level of 3,754 people . </P> <H2> Route Description ( edit ) </H2> The New York State Thruway in Yonkers <P> The New York State Thruway system is a collection of six individual components across the state of New York that connect the state to four neighboring states ( Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Jersey , and Pennsylvania ) as well as the Canadian province of Ontario . Together , the highways extend for 569.83 miles ( 917.05 km ) , making the Thruway system one of the largest toll highway systems in the United States . The longest of the six components is the 496 - mile ( 798 km ) mainline . Of the 570 miles in the Thruway system , 560.85 miles ( 902.60 km ) ( 98.4 % ) carries at least one Interstate Highway designation . Only three sections of the system are not part of the Interstate Highway System ; these are the Garden State Parkway Connector in Rockland County , a 6 - mile ( 10 km ) portion of the Berkshire Connector between exit 21A on the mainline near Selkirk and exit B1 in Schodack , and a short section of the mainline within exit 24 in Albany that is located between where I - 87 departs the roadway and I - 90 enters it . They are designated as New York State Route 982L ( NY 982L ) , NY 912M , and NY 915H , respectively , all unsigned reference routes . The speed limit , enforced by the New York State Police , is 65 miles per hour along most of the Thruway . </P> <P> I - 90 , which comprises the bulk of the mainline and the Berkshire Connector , runs for 365.55 miles ( 588.30 km ) along the Thruway : 17.70 miles ( 28.49 km ) as part of the Berkshire Connector and 347.85 miles ( 559.81 km ) on the mainline . I - 87 comprises the remaining 148.15 miles ( 238.42 km ) of the mainline , including an 18.86 - mile ( 30.35 km ) concurrency with I - 287 north of New York City . I - 287 covers another 29.76 miles ( 47.89 km ) ( including the 18.86 miles ( 30.35 km ) shared with I - 87 ) , while I - 190 spans 21.24 miles ( 34.18 km ) and I - 95 covers 15.01 miles ( 24.16 km ) . </P> <P> All highways maintained by the New York State Thruway Authority ( NYSTA ) lack the reference markers that exist on all New York State Department of Transportation - maintained roads , as would be expected . In their place , NYSTA - controlled roadways use small , square tenth - mile markers with a white background and blue numbering . These markers differ from the white - on - green reference markers used by NYSDOT on state - maintained highways , which are 10 inches ( 254 mm ) high and 8 inches ( 203 mm ) wide and display a limited amount of mileage information on their third row . </P> <H3> Mainline ( edit ) </H3> See also : Interstate 87 ( New York ) and Interstate 90 in New York South of Albany ( edit ) <P> The mainline of the Thruway begins , both in terms of exit numbers and mileposts , at the boundary between the New York City borough of the Bronx and the Westchester County city of Yonkers . Here , I - 87 changes from the Major Deegan Expressway to the Thruway as the mainline proceeds northward through Yonkers and southern Westchester County . It connects with Central Park Avenue ( NY 100 ) at exit 1 , the first of 12 exits within the county . The first few exits serve various local streets , with exit 2 providing access to Yonkers Raceway and exit 3 serving the Cross County Shopping Center . At exit 4 , I - 87 connects to the Cross County Parkway , an east -- west parkway providing access to the Saw Mill River , Bronx River , and Hutchinson River Parkways , all of which run parallel to the Thruway through Yonkers . The Hutchinson River and Bronx River parkways leave to the northeast midway through Yonkers , while the Saw Mill and Sprain Brook Parkways follow the Thruway out of the city . The last free exit heading northbound is at Ridge Hill Boulevard and Stew Leonard Drive ( exit 6A ) . Travel further north from there requires a toll payment at the Yonkers Toll Barrier . </P> Tappan Zee Bridge ( I - 87 and I - 287 ) <P> All three highways take generally parallel tracks to Elmsford , where I - 87 directly intersects the Saw Mill River Parkway at exit 7A . Not far to the north is exit 8 , a semi-directional T interchange with I - 287 ( the Cross-Westchester Expressway ) . I - 287 joins the Thruway here , following I - 87 west across the Hudson River into Rockland County on the Tappan Zee Bridge . I - 87 and I - 287 remain overlapped for 15 miles ( 24 km ) through the densely populated southern portion of Rockland County , meeting the Palisades Interstate Parkway and the New York segment of the Garden State Parkway at exits 13 and 14A , respectively . The Thruway continues generally westward to Suffern , where I - 87 and I - 287 split at a large semi-directional T interchange ( exit 15 ) near the New Jersey border . At this point , I - 287 heads south into New Jersey while I - 87 and the Thruway turn northward into the valley of the Ramapo River . Northbound Route 17 briefly joins the Thruway at the interchange with I - 287 in Suffern , and leaves the Thruway a half mile north at Exit 15A in Hillburn . </P> <P> The Thruway continues north through the river valley toward Harriman , where it encounters the Woodbury toll barrier , the southeastern end of the mainline 's major closed ticket system . The barrier is located on the mainline within exit 16 ( NY 17 ) , a trumpet interchange . Along with the mainline barrier in Harriman , an electronic toll gantry exists on the exit 16 ramp midway between the Thruway and NY 17 exit 131 ( NY 32 ) . Now a completely tolled highway , the Thruway heads northward , roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river 's west as it serves the city of Newburgh , the village of New Paltz , and the city of Kingston , indirectly connecting to the short I - 587 in the latter . </P> <P> Past Kingston , the highway runs closer to the river as it parallels U.S. Route 9W ( US 9W ) through the towns of Saugerties , Catskill , Coxsackie , and Ravena . Just north of Ravena , the Thruway meets the west end of the Berkshire Connector , a spur linking the Thruway mainline to the Massachusetts Turnpike 25 miles ( 40 km ) to the east . The highway continues into Albany , where it connects to Troy via I - 787 at exit 23 and intersects I - 90 at exit 24 . The latter of the two junctions is the busiest of the Thruway 's exits , serving an estimated 27 million vehicles a year . I - 87 leaves the Thruway mainline here while I - 90 merges into it , following the Thruway northwestward toward Schenectady . </P> Albany to Syracuse ( edit ) The New York State Thruway ( I - 87 ) looking east from Nordkop Mountain in Suffern <P> South of Schenectady , but still in Albany County , the Thruway and I - 90 meet I - 890 , a loop route of I - 90 that directly serves the downtown district of Schenectady , at exit 25 . The Thruway , meanwhile , bypasses the city to the south and west , intersecting I - 88 at exit 25A in Rotterdam before reuniting with I - 890 at exit 26 west of Scotia . Travel between I - 88 and exits 24 , 25 and 26 is toll - free . From exit 26 west to Utica , the mainline of the Thruway parallels the Erie Canal and the Mohawk River , crossing over the waterbodies at Mohawk . In between Schenectady and Utica , I - 90 and the Thruway serve several riverside communities , including the cities of Amsterdam ( exit 27 via NY 30 ) and Little Falls ( exit 29A , NY 169 ) and the villages of Fonda ( exit 28 , NY 30A ) , Canajoharie ( exit 29 , NY 5S and NY 10 ) , and Mohawk ( exit 30 , NY 28 ) . </P> <P> Like Schenectady before it , the Thruway bypasses downtown Utica , following an alignment north of the city while I - 790 serves it directly . I - 790 breaks from the Thruway at exit 31 and runs along two carriageways flanking the mainline on both sides for 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) before turning southward onto the North -- South Arterial . The adjacent highways become NY 49 , which parallel the Thruway for another 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) northwestward . At the end of this stretch , the Thruway turns slightly southwestward , crossing over the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal while NY 49 continues northwestward along the northern bank of the waterbodies toward Rome . On the other side of the river , the Thruway curves back to the west , proceeding to exit 32 in Westmoreland . </P> I - 90 , part of the New York State Thruway , looking east near Syracuse <P> Not far to the west , the Thruway has a junction with NY 365 at exit 33 in Verona . Here , the Thruway connects to the cities of Rome and Oneida and serves the Turning Stone Resort & Casino via NY 365 . The highway continues onward through a sparsely populated area between Verona and Syracuse , passing roughly 5 miles ( 8 km ) south of Oneida Lake as it connects to the village of Canastota by way of NY 13 at exit 34 . As the highway approaches exit 34A ( I - 481 ) outside of Syracuse , the surroundings become more developed . The level of development rises sharply west of I - 481 as the Thruway enters Salina , a northern suburb of Syracuse . Within Salina , I - 90 and the Thruway intersect I - 81 , which connects the Thruway to both downtown Syracuse and Syracuse Hancock International Airport . </P> Syracuse to Buffalo ( edit ) <P> West of Salina , the Thruway passes north of Liverpool and Onondaga Lake before intersecting I - 690 and its northern continuation , NY 690 , at exit 39 in Van Buren . At this point , the amount of development along the Thruway sharply declines as it heads generally westward through a marshy area of Onondaga County . I - 90 and the Thruway reconnect to the Erie Canal ( here part of the Seneca River ) at the western county line . Now in Cayuga County , the highway serves Weedsport via exit 40 and NY 34 , exit 41 serving Del Lago Resort and Casino in Tyre , New York and passes north of Port Byron prior to entering Seneca County and the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge . Here , the canal leaves the Thruway for good , turning northwestward to follow the NY 31 corridor to Rochester and beyond . </P> Advance signage for exit 45 ( I - 490 ) <P> The portion of the Thruway between Montezuma and the Rochester area is one of mostly rural nature , with the highway passing through remote , open fields , and for the most part avoiding highly populated areas . Along this stretch , it connects to two cities , both located well to the south of the Thruway : Geneva by way of exit 42 for NY 14 and Canandaigua by way of exit 43 via NY 21 . The next exit along the highway , exit 44 for NY 332 , also serves Canandaigua ; the junction is the primary exit for Canandaigua - bound travelers from the Rochester area . Here , the Thruway temporarily widens from four to six lanes as it continues generally westward to meet I - 490 at exit 45 near Victor . Like in the vicinity of Schenectady and Utica , an auxiliary route of I - 90 -- here I - 490 -- directly serves a city ( Rochester ) while the Thruway bypasses it . </P> <P> It heads northwestward through the city 's southern , mostly rural suburbs to Henrietta , where it meets I - 390 at exit 46 . Henrietta is as close as the Thruway gets to downtown as it proceeds west to Le Roy , where I - 490 reconnects to I - 90 at exit 47 . I - 90 continues onward into Genesee County , intersecting with NY 98 at exit 48 north of Batavia and NY 77 at exit 48A in Pembroke . The latter exit provides access to Darien Lake , a large amusement park located in the town of Darien . I - 90 and the Thruway continue into Erie County and the Buffalo area . It meets NY 78 at exit 49 near Depew before passing through the Williamsville toll barrier , the northwestern end of the major closed ticket system . </P> West of Buffalo ( edit ) <P> Just west of the toll barrier , I - 90 and the Thruway -- now toll - free -- connect to I - 290 via exit 50 , a semi-directional T interchange . At this point , the Thruway turns southward , passing through the immediate eastern suburbs of Buffalo . As it heads south , it meets the Kensington Expressway ( NY 33 ) at exit 51 and Walden Avenue at exit 52 , both cloverleaf interchanges . At exit 52 , it passes to the west of the Walden Galleria , a shopping mall situated at the nearby junction of Walden Avenue and NY 277 . Two exits later in southern Cheektowaga , I - 90 meets I - 190 , a spur route leading to downtown Buffalo and Niagara Falls , at exit 53 . </P> NYS Thruway near Silver Creek <P> South of the city , the Thruway meets the Aurora Expressway ( NY 400 ) and the Southern Expressway ( US 219 ) at exits 54 and 55 , respectively , in West Seneca . Just southwest of exit 55 , I - 90 and the Thruway pass through the Lackawanna toll barrier , which serves as the northeast end of the minor closed ticket system . Once again a toll road , the Thruway heads southwestward , roughly paralleling the shoreline of Lake Erie to Blasdell , where it connects to NY 179 ( the Milestrip Expressway ) . Farther southwestward , the Thruway is joined by US 20 , which follows a parallel routing to that of the Thruway to the Pennsylvania state line . </P> <P> As the route passes from Erie County to Chautauqua County , the last on its routing , it cuts through the northwestern portion of the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation , situated on Cattaraugus Creek . The Thruway continues alongside US 20 past Dunkirk and Westfield to the Ripley toll barrier , the southwestern end of the minor closed ticket system just northeast of exit 61 for Shortman Road . Travelers heading eastbound from Pennsylvania can access Shortman Road toll - free . The Thruway ends about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) after exit 61 at the Pennsylvania state line . I - 90 , however , continues onward into Pennsylvania as a toll - free highway . </P> <H3> Berkshire Connector ( edit ) </H3> See also : Interstate 90 in New York <P> The Berkshire Connector is a 24.28 - mile ( 39.07 km ) east -- west spur connecting the Thruway mainline in Coeymans to the Massachusetts Turnpike at the Massachusetts state line in Canaan . It is tolled as part of the closed ticket system in place on the mainline between exits 16 and 50 . The highway begins at exit 21A off the Thruway southwest of Selkirk in the town of Coeymans ( south of Albany ) as NY 912M , an unsigned reference route . It proceeds eastward over the Hudson River and into Rensselaer County by way of the Castleton - on - Hudson Bridge . It navigates through the southern , rural portion of the county to exit B1 in Schodack , where the connector meets I - 90 . The unsigned NY 912M designation terminates here while I - 90 joins the Berkshire Connector and follows the spur east into Columbia County . </P> <P> While the Rensselaer County segment follows a mostly east -- west routing , the Berkshire Connector in Columbia County takes on a northwest - southeast alignment as the roadway heads towards exit B2 in East Chatham . The junction serves as the northern terminus of the Taconic State Parkway , which connects the spur to the New York City area . About 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) to the southeast is the Canaan toll barrier , which marks the end of the Thruway ticket system . The last exit on the Berkshire Connector is exit B3 for NY 22 just west of the Massachusetts state line in Canaan . The spur continues east to the state line , where it becomes the Massachusetts Turnpike . </P> <H3> Garden State Parkway Connector ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Garden State Parkway Connector is a 2.40 - mile ( 3.86 km ) highway that connects the Thruway mainline at exit 14A in Ramapo with the Garden State Parkway at the New Jersey state line . It is designated as NY 982L , an unsigned reference route . The highway begins , in terms of mileposts , at Thruway ( I - 87 and I - 287 ) exit 14A in Ramapo and heads generally southwestward as a toll - free highway toward the state line . Just north of the state line , the southbound connector meets Red Schoolhouse Road ( County Route 41 or CR 41 ) at a partial diamond interchange . All southbound commercial traffic is forced to exit here as the Garden State Parkway prohibits commercial traffic north of exit 105 . Thus , the final 0.31 miles ( 0.50 km ) of the road south of the Red Schoolhouse Road exit is the only part of the Thruway system that prohibits commercial vehicles . The connector continues to the state line , where it becomes the tolled Garden State Parkway . </P> <H3> Other components ( edit ) </H3> <P> The New York State Thruway system also consists of three other components : the Cross-Westchester Expressway , the New England Thruway and the Niagara Thruway . The Cross-Westchester Expressway , part of I - 287 , begins at I - 87 exit 8 in Elmsford , where I - 287 splits from the Thruway mainline , and travels east across Westchester County to I - 95 , with connections to both the New England Thruway and the Connecticut Turnpike at exit 12 in Rye . The New England Thruway ( NET ) is a 15.01 - mile ( 24.16 km ) section of I - 95 under the operation and maintenance of the New York State Thruway Authority . It begins at the Pelham Parkway interchange ( exit 8 ) in the Co-Op City section of the Bronx and continues northeastward into Westchester County to the Connecticut state line , where it connects to the Connecticut Turnpike . The Niagara Thruway comprises the first 21.24 miles ( 34.18 km ) of I - 190 from I - 90 in Buffalo to NY 384 in Niagara Falls . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Origins and construction ( edit ) </H3> <P> A toll superhighway connecting the major cities of the state of New York that would become part of a larger nationwide highway network was proposed as early as 1949 . The following year , the New York State Legislature passed the Thruway Authority Act creating the New York State Thruway Authority ( NYSTA ) , an independent public corporation , which would build and manage the turnpike . The project was to be financed through toll revenue bonds and self - liquidating by receipt of tolls , rents , concessions , and other income . The act also stipulated NYSTA adopt a hybrid system of tolls , with barrier tolls collected in urban areas , and long - distance tickets issued in rural areas . </P> <P> The first section of the Thruway , between Utica and Rochester , opened on June 24 , 1954 . Other sections of the 426 - mile ( 686 km ) mainline between Buffalo and the Bronx were completed and opened throughout 1954 and 1955 . The last segment , from Yonkers south to the Bronx , was completed on August 31 , 1956 . The total cost was $600 million ( equivalent to $4.15 billion in 2016 ) , financed by the sale of $972 million in bonds ( equivalent to $6.73 billion in 2016 ) . At the time , it was the longest toll road in the world . In 1957 , the mainline was extended 70 miles ( 113 km ) west from Buffalo along Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania state line . From 1957 to 1960 , several spurs of the road were built to connect the road to turnpikes in adjacent states . These were the Berkshire Connector which opened on May 26 , 1959 , which linked to the Massachusetts Turnpike ( itself opening eastwards from close to the New York state line on May 15 , 1957 ) , the New England Thruway , which connected to the Connecticut Turnpike , and the Niagara Thruway , a spur leading to Niagara Falls . </P> <P> On August 14 , 1957 , the segment of the mainline between the Pennsylvania border and the Adirondack Northway in Albany became part of I - 90 while the portions from the Northway south to Newburgh and from Elmsford south to the New York City line were included in I - 87 . The eastern half of the Berkshire Connector also became part of I - 90 , creating a gap in the I - 90 designation around Albany . The entirety of the New England Thruway became part of I - 95 while the Niagara Thruway became I - 90N , and later I - 190 . The Elmsford -- Suffern section of the mainline was designated as part of I - 287 by 1960 . The last section of the mainline to receive a designation -- from Suffern to Newburgh -- finally received one on January 1 , 1970 , when I - 87 was realigned to follow the Thruway between the two locations . The highway was unique in that original signage utilized dark blue backgrounds , the same color blue as displayed on the New York state flag . Over time , these signs were replaced with Federal Highway Administration ( FHWA ) - approved green backgrounds . </P> <H3> System expansion ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the New Jersey Turnpike was built in 1952 , the New Jersey Turnpike Authority ( NJTA ) and NYSTA proposed a 13 - mile ( 21 km ) extension of the New Jersey Turnpike that would go from its end ( at US 46 in Ridgefield Park , New Jersey , at the time ) up to West Nyack at the Thruway . The portion through New Jersey was to be constructed and maintained by NJTA , while the portion in New York was to be built and maintained by NYSTA . The purpose of this extension was to give motorists a `` more direct bypass of the New York City area '' to New England by using the Tappan Zee Bridge . The extension was to parallel NY 303 and the Conrail - owned River Line , and have limited interchanges , one of which would be with the Palisades Interstate Parkway . By 1970 , it became too expensive to buy right - of - way access , and community opposition was fierce . Therefore , both the NJTA and NYSTA cancelled the project . </P> <P> In 1990 , the state of New York sold the Cross-Westchester Expressway ( part of I - 287 ) to NYSTA for $20 million ( equivalent to $33.4 million in 2016 ) in an effort to balance the state 's budget . Similarly , in 1991 , the Authority was directed to assume the cost of operating and maintaining the 71 - mile ( 114 km ) segment of I - 84 in New York , which runs east -- west from the Pennsylvania state line at Port Jervis to the Connecticut state line at Brewster . The agreement made at this time between NYSTA and the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) allowed NYSTA to transfer I - 84 back to the state at any point after 1996 provided that the Thruway Authority gave NYSDOT a one - year notice . Around this time , state officials also investigated the possibility of having NYSTA take over ownership and maintenance of all or part of New York 's Interstate Highways . </P> <H3> Toll elimination and I - 84 ( edit ) </H3> <P> All tolls along the Thruway were supposed to be abolished when the construction bonds used to build it had been paid off . The last of the bonds were paid off in 1996 ; however , the tolls remained in place after the New York State Legislature transferred ownership of the New York State Canal System to NYSTA in 1992 . </P> Thruway Authority maintenance sign at onramps on I - 84 <P> Roughly one week before the November 2006 elections , NYSTA accepted $14 million from the State Senate in exchange for agreeing to cease the collection of tolls at the Black Rock and City Line toll barriers on the Niagara Thruway ( I - 190 ) in Buffalo for one year . On October 30 , 2006 , NYSTA voted to permanently remove the tolls . Both major candidates in the 2006 gubernatorial election , Democrat and eventual victor Eliot Spitzer and Republican John Faso , had pledged to remove the tolls on I - 190 if elected . In order to offset the lost toll revenue , NYSTA also voted to return maintenance of I - 84 to NYSDOT , as the annual maintenance cost of I - 84 was considered to be equal to the amount of annual revenue generated from the Buffalo toll barriers -- approximately $14 million . Under the terms of the 1991 agreement between NYSTA and NYSDOT , maintenance of I - 84 would become the responsibility of the DOT on October 30 , 2007 . </P> In the late 1970s , NYSTA experimented with all - metric signage in the Syracuse area , such as these signs at exit 35 . <P> In January 2007 , State Senator John Bonacic of Mount Hope began drafting legislation to halt the planned transfer of maintenance of I - 84 . Bonacic asserted that the Thruway Authority had better maintenance practices than NYSDOT , most notably in the field of snow removal . He also claimed that the DOT lacked the time and money needed to match the quality of maintenance that NYSTA performed on I - 84 . The senator eventually prevailed as the 2007 -- 2008 budget was modified to allocate additional funding to NYSDOT , which would then pay the Thruway Authority to maintain I - 84 . A formal agreement between the two agencies was reached on September 19 . The one - year agreement cost NYSDOT $11.5 million and took effect October 30 , the date I - 84 was to become DOT - maintained . The agreement was renewed in April 2008 at a cost of $10.3 million , extending the arrangement through October 31 , 2009 . It remained in place until October 11 , 2010 , when NYSDOT re-assumed maintenance of the highway . The change was made in the 2010 -- 2011 state budget in an effort to reduce the cost of maintaining I - 84 . Governor David Paterson -- who included the change in the budget -- expected that the state would save $3.9 million annually on maintenance costs . </P> <H3> Other developments ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1964 , the New York State Legislature officially renamed the Thruway in honor of Thomas E. Dewey , the Governor of New York at the time of the Thruway 's opening . The official designation is , however , rarely used in reference to the road . </P> <P> In August 1993 , NYSTA became the first agency to implement the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system . By December 1996 , it was implemented at all of the Thruway 's fixed - toll barriers and at exits along the Berkshire Connector and the New York City -- Buffalo section of the mainline . E-ZPass was installed at all of the mainline exits by March 1998 . On May 14 , 2010 , a new E-ZPass configuration , consisting of two highway speed E-ZPass lanes in each direction , became operational at the Woodbury toll plaza , with concrete barriers separating the faster traffic from the staffed toll lanes necessary for vehicles not equipped for E-ZPass . </P> <P> In 1999 NYSDOT , the Federal Highway Administration and NYSTA discussed redesignating the Berkshire Connector as I - 90 and redesignating the non-toll part of I - 90 from Thruway exit 24 to exit B1 as I - 88 . The Thruway main line would be designated as both I - 90 and I - 88 between exits 25A and 24 , and as I - 90 and I - 87 from exit 24 to exit 21A . This was never implemented . </P> <P> When I - 84 was built through the Newburgh area in the early 1960s , no interchange was built between I - 84 and the Thruway . Instead , the connection was made via a short segment of NY 300 , which both I - 84 and I - 87 meet via interchanges . Construction on a direct connection between the Thruway mainline and I - 84 began in August 2003 . The portion of the exit carrying traffic from I - 84 to the Thruway was opened in July 2009 . The opposite direction was opened two months later on September 23 . The connection allows cars to travel between I - 87 , I - 84 and NY 300 via splits in the ramp . </P> <H2> Services ( edit ) </H2> All of I - 90 within New York is designated as the `` AMVETS Memorial Highway '' , as indicated by this sign at the Port Byron service area . <P> There are 27 service areas along the Thruway , all on the New York -- Ripley mainline . The service areas , called `` travel plazas '' by the New York State Thruway Authority ( NYSTA ) , are spaced roughly 30 miles ( 48 km ) apart and are open at all hours of the day . Two plazas -- the Angola service area at milepost 447 and the New Baltimore plaza at milepost 127 -- are accessible from both directions of the Thruway ; the remainder are accessible from only one direction . Each plaza features a gas station and a variety of restaurants , at least one of which is open 24 hours . Free Wi - Fi service was added to all 27 service areas on March 1 , 2007 . </P> <P> NYSTA also operates the Thruway Authority Highway Advisory Radio ( HAR ) system , a network of radio stations across the state that broadcast information on traffic conditions along the Thruway . The system broadcasts at 1610 AM in the Buffalo , Rochester , Albany , Kingston , and Newburgh areas , 1620 AM in the Finger Lakes and Syracuse areas , 530 AM in the New York City metropolitan area , 540 AM in the vicinity of Utica , and at 98.7 FM in Chautauqua County . HAR is also used to broadcast Amber Alerts if one is issued . </P> <P> </P> <H3> Travel plazas ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Location </Th> <Th> Direction </Th> <Th> Milepost </Th> <Th> Services </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ardsley </Td> <Td> Greenburgh </Td> <Td> Northbound </Td> <Td> 6.0 miles ( 9.7 km ) </Td> <Td> Burger King , E-ZPass On -

The New York -- Ripley mainline employs both an open , barrier - based tolling system and a closed , ticket - based tolling system . From the New York City line to the NY 17 exit near Harriman , there are three toll barriers . From there northward , a closed system is employed where drivers must obtain tickets which show their point of entry and the cost of traveling from there to their desired point of exit . Upon exiting the Thruway , the ticket must be surrendered and the appropriate toll must be paid . Two separate closed systems are used on the Thruway mainline , encompassing all of the mainline between Harriman and the Pennsylvania state line except for a section in and around Buffalo . </P> <P> The southernmost of the three toll barriers is the Yonkers toll barrier , a bi-directional barrier between exits 6A and 7 in Yonkers . In South Nyack , there is a southbound - only toll gantry for the Tappan Zee Bridge that uses all - electronic tolling at highway speeds , with tolls collected by E-ZPass or Tolls by Mail . Lastly , there is a northbound , commercial traffic - only barrier in Spring Valley . The closed ticket system originally began at the Spring Valley toll barrier but was moved to exit 16 on March 3 , 1974 , allowing interchanges along the Thruway in Rockland County to be free of tolls . The toll plaza at Suffern was dismantled along with this change . On April 23 , 2016 , the southbound toll plaza at the Tappan Zee Bridge in Westchester County was closed and replaced with an southbound all - electronic toll gantry on the Rockland County side of the bridge , with tolls payable by E-ZPass or Tolls by Mail . At Harriman , the longer of the two closed , ticket - based systems begins and extends from NY 17 to just east of exit 50 in Amherst . The Berkshire Connector is enclosed within this ticket system , so traveling between the mainline and the connector via exit 21A does not involve crossing a toll barrier , and the connector 's exits up to the toll barrier at exit B3 are listed with the mainline exits on tickets for the major closed system . The other system encompasses the portion of the mainline between exit 56 south of Buffalo and exit 61 near the Pennsylvania state line . </P> <P> To distinguish between exit 16 and the Woodbury toll barrier , Thruway tickets list the NY 17 interchange as exit 16 and the Woodbury toll plaza as exit 15 , although the actual exit 15 is situated almost 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the south . Northbound traffic on I - 87 traveling through the Woodbury toll barrier is given a ticket while travelers on southbound I - 87 must surrender their ticket and pay the appropriate toll . Traffic heading south on I - 87 and exiting at exit 16 must pay the appropriate toll for exit 16 at the Harriman toll plaza . Similarly , traffic heading north on I - 87 and exiting at exit 16 are charged a fixed - rate toll electronically using E-ZPass or Tolls - By - Mail at the Harriman toll gantry . Traffic entering the Thruway from NY 17 east are charged a toll electronically at the Harriman gantry and , if traveling north , collect a ticket at the Woodbury barrier . ( However , this latter situation is less likely to occur because traffic on 17 eastbound is most likely headed south towards New York City , because of 17 's south - east gradient beyond Binghamton . ) The ticket is identical to that given for exit 15 with the exception that the toll for exit 16 is subtracted from all of the prices . </P> Approaching the Williamsville toll barrier on I - 90 / Thruway westbound <P> The other components of the system that are tolled have far fewer tolls . On the New England Thruway ( I - 95 ) , there is a single , fixed - rate toll barrier on I - 95 northbound in New Rochelle . Meanwhile , the only tolls along the Niagara Thruway ( I - 190 ) are those for major bridges along the highway , namely the North and South Grand Island Bridges . </P> <H3> Cost ( edit ) </H3> <P> When the Thruway opened in the mid-1950s , the cost to travel from Buffalo to New York City was $5.60 ( equivalent to $41.00 in 2016 ) . The closed ticket system , which at the time extended from Spring Valley to Williamsville , accounted for $5 of the toll , while the remaining $0.60 was charged at the Yonkers ( $0.10 ) and Tappan Zee ( $0.50 ) toll barriers . As of April 2010 , this trip costs $24.60 : $18.35 for the closed ticket system from Williamsville to Woodbury , $5 for the Tappan Zee Bridge , and $1.25 for the Yonkers toll barrier . After the south end of the major closed ticket system was moved from Spring Valley to Woodbury , the Spring Valley toll barrier became a fixed - rate toll for both cars and trucks . The toll for cars was removed in July 1997 . At the time , the toll was $0.40 ( equivalent to $1.00 in 2016 ) . </P> <P> As of April 2010 , the Berkshire Connector costs $0.85 to travel between the Massachusetts state line and exit B1 . Tolls west of exit B1 vary based on which direction a motorist travels on I - 87 . The toll on the minor closed ticket system from Pennsylvania to exit 55 south of Buffalo is $3.15 . On I - 190 , the Grand Island Bridges cost $1 to cross while the New Rochelle toll barrier on I - 95 costs $1.75 to pass through . The Black Rock and City Line toll barriers on the Niagara Thruway in Buffalo charged $0.75 at the time of their removal on October 30 , 2006 . </P> <H2> Exit list ( edit ) </H2> <P> For exits on the Cross-Westchester Expressway , the New England Thruway , or the Niagara Thruway , see the articles on those highways . </P> <H3> Mainline ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> County </Th> <Th> Location </Th> <Th> mi </Th> <Th> km </Th> <Th> Exit </Th> <Th> Destinations </Th> <Th> Notes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Westchester </Td> <Td> Yonkers </Td> <Th> 0.00 </Th> <Td> 0.00 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td_colspan=\\\"1\\\"> I -

These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training . It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or `` folk '' music . Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music , although since the beginning of the recording industry , it is also disseminated through recordings . Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally , or to smaller , local audiences . </P> <P> The original application of the term is to music of the 1880s Tin Pan Alley period in the United States . Although popular music sometimes is known as `` pop music '' , the two terms are not interchangeable . Popular music is a generic term for a wide variety of genres of music that appeal to the tastes of a large segment of the population , whereas pop music usually refers to a specific musical genre within popular music . Popular music songs and pieces typically have easily singable melodies . The song structure of popular music commonly involves repetition of sections , with the verse and chorus or refrain repeating throughout the song and the bridge providing a contrasting and transitional section within a piece . </P> <P> In the 2000s , with songs and pieces available as digital sound files , it has become easier for music to spread from one country or region to another . Some popular music forms have become global , while others have a wide appeal within the culture of their origin . Through the mixture of musical genres , new popular music forms are created to reflect the ideals of a global culture . The examples of Africa , Indonesia , and the Middle East show how Western pop music styles can blend with local musical traditions to create new hybrid styles . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Definition </Li> <Li> 2 Form of Western popular music </Li> <Li> 3 Development in North America and Europe <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Industry </Li> <Li> 3.2 Criticism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Global perspective <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Africa </Li> <Li> 4.2 Asia <Ul> <Li> 4.2. 1 Indonesia </Li> <Li> 4.2. 2 China </Li> <Li> 4.2. 3 Middle East </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Definition ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Folk music See also : Art music \\u00a7 Popular music <P> Scholars have classified music as `` popular '' based on various factors , including whether a song or piece becomes known to listeners mainly from hearing the music ( in contrast with classical music , in which many musicians learn pieces from sheet music ) ; its appeal to diverse listeners , its treatment as a marketplace commodity in a capitalist context , and other factors . Sales of ' recordings ' or sheet music are one measure . Middleton and Manuel note that this definition has problems because multiple listens or plays of the same song or piece are not counted . Evaluating appeal based on size of audience ( mass appeal ) or whether audience is of a certain social class is another way to define popular music , but this , too , has problems in that social categories of people can not be applied accurately to musical styles . Manuel states that one criticism of popular music is that it is produced by large media conglomerates and passively consumed by the public , who merely buy or reject what music is being produced . He claims that the listeners in the scenario would not have been able to make the choice of their favorite music , which negates the previous conception of popular music . Moreover , `` understandings of popular music have changed with time '' . Middleton argues that if research were to be done on the field of popular music , there would be a level of stability within societies to characterize historical periods , distribution of music , and the patterns of influence and continuity within the popular styles of music . </P> <P> Anahid Kassabian separated popular music into four categories ; `` popular as populist , '' or having overtones of liberation and expression ; `` popular as folk , '' or stating that the music is written by the people , for themselves ; `` popular as counterculture , '' or empowering citizens to act against the oppression they face ; and `` popular as mass , '' or the music becomes the tool for oppression . A society 's popular music reflects the ideals that are prevalent at the time it is performed or published . David Riesman states that the youth audiences of popular music fit into either a majority group or a subculture . The majority group listens to the commercially produced styles while the subcultures find a minority style to transmit their own values . This allows youth to choose what music they identify with , which gives them power as consumers to control the market of popular music . </P> <H2> Form of Western popular music ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Song structure <P> Form in popular music is most often sectional , the most common sections being verse , chorus or refrain , and bridge . Other common forms include thirty - two - bar form , chorus form * ( Middleton pg 30 ) , and twelve - bar blues . Popular music songs are rarely composed using different music for each stanza of the lyrics ( songs composed in this fashion are said to be `` through - composed '' ) . </P> <P> The verse and chorus are considered the primary elements . Each verse usually has the same melody ( possibly with some slight modifications ) , but the lyrics change for most verses . The chorus ( or `` refrain '' ) usually has a melodic phrase and a key lyrical line which is repeated . Pop songs may have an introduction and coda ( `` tag '' ) , but these elements are not essential to the identity of most songs . Pop songs that use verses and choruses often have a bridge , which , as its name suggests , is a section which connects the verse and chorus at one or more points in the song . </P> <P> The verse and chorus are usually repeated throughout a song , while the bridge , intro , and coda ( also called an `` outro '' ) tend to be used only once . Some pop songs may have a solo section , particularly in rock or blues - influenced pop . During the solo section , one or more instruments play a melodic line which may be the melody used by the singer , or , in blues - or jazz - influenced pop , the solo may be improvised based on the chord progression . A solo usually features a single instrumental performer ( e.g. , a guitarist or a harmonica player ) or less commonly , more than one instrumentalist ( e.g. , a trumpeter and a sax player ) . </P> <P> Thirty - two - bar form uses four sections , most often eight measures long each ( 4 \\u00d7 8 = 32 ) , two verses or A sections , a contrasting B section ( the bridge or `` middle - eight '' ) and a return of the verse in one last A section ( AABA ) . Verse - chorus form or ABA form may be combined with AABA form , in compound AABA forms . Variations such as a1 and a2 can also be used . The repetition of one chord progression may mark off the only section in a simple verse form such as the twelve bar blues . </P> <H2> Development in North america and europe ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Industry ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Music industry <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

The availability of inexpensive , widely available sheet music versions of popular songs and instrumental music pieces made it possible for music to be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur , middle - class music - makers , who could play and sing popular music at home . Amateur music - making in the 19th century often centred around the piano , as this instrument could play melodies , chords and basslines , thus enabling a pianist to reproduce popular songs and pieces . In addition to the influence of sheet music , another factor was the increasing availability during the late 18th and early 19th century of public popular music performances in `` pleasure gardens and dance halls , popular theatres and concert rooms '' . </P> <P> The early popular music performers worked hand - in - hand with the sheet music industry to promote popular sheet music . One of the early popular music performers to attain widespread popularity was a Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind , who toured the US in the mid-19th century . In addition to living room amateur music - making during the 19th century , more people began getting involved in music during this era by participating in amateur choirs , joining brass bands or playing in amateur orchestras . </P> <P> The centre of the music publishing industry in the US during the late 19th century was in New York 's ' Tin Pan Alley ' district . The Tin Pan Alley music publishers developed a new method for promoting sheet music : incessant promotion of new songs . One of the technological innovations that helped to spread popular music around the turn of the century was player pianos . A player piano could be used to record a skilled pianist 's rendition of a piano piece . This recorded performance could be `` played back '' on another player piano . This allowed a larger number of music lovers to hear the new popular piano tunes . By the early 1900s , the big trends in popular music were the increasing popularity of vaudeville theaters and dance halls and a new invention -- the gramophone player . The record industry grew very rapidly ; `` By 1920 there were almost 80 record companies in Britain , and almost 200 in the USA '' . The availability of records enabled a larger percentage of the population to hear the top singers and bands . </P> <P> Radio broadcasting of music , which began in the early 1920s , helped to spread popular songs to a huge audience , enabling a much larger proportion of the population to hear songs performed by professional singers and music ensembles , including individuals from lower income groups who previously would not have been able to afford concert tickets . Radio broadcasting increased the ability of songwriters , singers and bandleaders to become nationally known . Another factor which helped to disseminate popular music was the introduction of `` talking pictures '' -- sound films -- in the late 1920s , which also included music and songs . In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s , there was a move towards consolidation in the recording industry , which led several major companies to dominate the record industry . </P> <P> In the 1950s and 1960s , the new invention of television began to play an increasingly important role in disseminating new popular music . Variety shows regularly showcased popular singers and bands . In the 1960s , the development of new technologies in recording , such as multitrack recorders gave sound engineers and record producers an increasingly important role in popular music . By using multitrack recording techniques , sound engineers could create new sounds and sound effects that were not possible using traditional `` live '' recording techniques , such as singers performing their own backup vocals or having lead guitarists play rhythm guitars behind their guitar solo . During the 1960s era of psychedelic music , the recording studio was used to create even more unusual sounds , in order to mimic the effect of taking hallucinogenic drugs , some songs used tapes of instruments played backwards or panned the music from one side to the other of the stereo image . </P> <P> In the 1970s , the trend towards consolidation in the recording industry continued to the point that the `` ... dominance was in the hands of five huge transnational organizations , three American - owned ( WEA , RCA , CBS ) and two European - owned companies ( EMI , Polygram ) '' . In the 1990s , the consolidation trend took a new turn : inter-media consolidation . This trend saw music recording companies being consolidated with film , television , magazines , and other media companies , an approach which facilitated cross-marketing promotion between subsidiaries . For example , a record company 's singing star could be cross-promoted by the conglomerate 's television talk shows and magazine arms . </P> <P> The `` introduction of digital equipment ( mixing desks , synthesizers , samplers , sequencers ) '' in the 1990s resulted in what Grove Dictionary of Music dubbed the creation of `` new sound worlds '' , as well as facilitating DIY music production by amateur musicians and `` tiny independent record labels '' . In the 1990s , the availability of sound recording software and effects units software meant that an amateur indie band could record an album -- which required a fully equipped recording studio in previous decades -- using little more than a laptop and a good quality microphone . That said , the audio quality of modern recording studios still outstrips what an amateur can produce . </P> <H3> Criticism ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Music journalist See also : Rockism and poptimism <H2> Global perspective ( edit ) </H2> <P> In contrast to Western popular music , a genre of music that is popular outside of a Western nation , is categorized into World music . This label turns otherwise popular styles of music into an exotic and unknown category . The Western concept of ' World Music ' homogenizes many different genres of popular music under one accessible term for Western audiences . New media technology has led urban music styles to filter into distant rural areas across the globe . The rural areas , in turn , are able to give feedback to the urban centers about the new styles of music . Urbanization , modernization , exposure to foreign music and mass media have contributed to hybrid urban pop styles . The hybrid styles have also found a space within Western popular music through the expressions of their national culture . Recipient cultures borrow elements from host cultures and alter the meaning and context found in the host culture . Many Western styles , in turn , have become international styles through multinational recording studios . </P> <H3> Africa ( edit ) </H3> See also : African popular music Senegalese rapper , Didier Awadi <P> Popular African music styles have stemmed from traditional entertainment genres , rather than evolving from music used with certain traditional ceremonies like weddings , births , or funerals . African popular music as a whole has been influenced by European countries , African - American and Afro - Latin music , and region - specific styles that became popular across a wider range of people . Although due to the significance and strong position of culture in traditional African music , African popular music tends to stay within the roots of traditional African Popular Music . The genre of music , Maskanda , is popular in its culture of origin , South Africa . Although maskanda is a traditional music genre by definition , the people who listen to it influence the ideals that are brought forth in the music . A popular maskandi artist , Phuzekhemisi , had to lessen the political influence within his music to be ready for the public sphere . His music producer , West Nikosi , was looking for the commercial success in Phuzekhemisi 's music rather than starting a political controversy . </P> <P> Political songs have been an important category of African popular music in many societies . During the continent 's struggle against colonial rule , nationalistic songs boosted citizens ' morale . These songs were based on Western marches and hymns reflecting the European education system that the early nationalistic leaders grew up in . Not all African political songs were based on Western styles . For example , in South Africa , the political songs during the Anti-Apartheid Movement were based on traditional tribal styles along with hybrid forms of imported genres . Activists used protest and freedom songs to persuade individuals to take action , become educated with the struggle , and empower others to be politically conscious . These songs reflected the nuances between the different classes involved in the liberation struggle . </P> <P> One of the genres people of Africa use for political expression is Hip hop . Although hip hop in Africa is based on the North American template , it has been remade to produce new meanings for African young people . This allows the genre to be both locally and globally influential . African youth are shaped by the fast - growing genre 's ability to communicate , educate , empower , and entertain . Artists who would have started in traditional music genres , like maskanda , became hip hop artists to provide a stronger career path for themselves . These rappers compare themselves to the traditional artists like the griot and oral storyteller , who both had a role in reflecting on the internal dynamics of the larger society . African hip hop creates youth culture , community intelligence , and global solidarity . </P> <H3> Asia ( edit ) </H3> Indonesia ( edit ) See also : Music of Indonesia KRAS , also known as Heavy Metal Punk Machine , is an Indonesian heavy metal band <P> Popular music in Indonesia can be categorized as hybrid forms of Western rock to genres that are originated in Indonesia and indigenous in style . The genre of music , Dangdut , is a genre of popular music specifically found in Indonesia . Dangdut formed two other styles of popular music , Indo - pop and Underground , together to create a new hybrid or fusion genre . The genre takes the noisy instrumentation from Underground , but still makes it easy to listen to like Indo - pop . Dangdut attempts to form many popular music genres like rock , pop , and traditional music to create this new sound that lines up with the consumers ' tastes . This genre has formed into a larger social movement that includes clothing , youth culture , the resurgence of Islam , and the capitalist entertainment industry . </P> <P> Another music scene that is popular in Indonesia is Punk rock . This genre was shaped in Indonesia by the local interpretations of the media from the larger global punk movement . Jeremy Wallach argues that while Green Day was seen as the `` death of punk , '' in Indonesia they were the catalyst for a larger punk movement . Punk in Indonesia calls on the English - speaking world to embrace the global sects of the punk culture and become open - minded to the transnational genre . </P> China ( edit ) <P> In a 2015 study involving young students in Shanghai , youths stated they enjoyed listening to both Chinese , other Asian nationalities , and Anglo - American popular music . There are three ways that young people of China were able to access global music . The first reason was a policy change since the late 1970s where the country was opened up to the rest of the world instead of being self - contained . This created more opportunities for Chinese people to interact with people outside of their country of origin to create a more globalized culture . The second reason is that the Chinese television and music industry since the 1980s has broadcast television shows from their neighboring Asian societies and the West . The third reason is the impact of the internet and smartphones on the accessibility of streaming music . </P> <P> In 2015 , students in China accounted for 30.2 % of China 's internet population and the third and fifth most popular uses of the internet were respectively , internet music and internet video use . The youths described being able to connect to the emotions and language of the Chinese music , but also enjoyed the melodies found within Anglo - American music . The students also believed that listening to the English music would improve their English language skills . </P> Middle East ( edit ) Iranian rock band Kiosk , live in 2007 <P> Modernization of music in the Arab world involved borrowing inspiration from Turkish music and Western musical styles . The late Egyptian singer , Umm Kulthum , stated , </P> <P> `` We must respect ourselves and our art . The Indians have set a good example for us - they show great respect for themselves and their arts . Wherever they are , they wear their native dress and their music is known throughout the world . This is the right way . '' </P> <P> She discussed this to explain why Egypt and the Arab world needed to take pride in the popular music styles originating in their culture so the styles were not lost in the modernization . Local musicians learned Western instrumental styles to create their own popular styles including their native languages and indigenous musical features . Communities in throughout the Arab world place high value on their indigenous musical identities while assimilating to new musical styles from neighboring countries or mass media . Through the 1980s and 1990s , popular music has been seen as a problem for the Iranian government because of the non-religious meanings within the music and the bodily movements of dancing or headbanging . During this time period , metal became a popular underground subculture through the Middle East . Just like their Western counterparts , Middle Eastern metal followers expressed their feelings of alienation . But their thoughts came from war and social restrictions on youth . </P> <P> In interviews of Iranian teenagers between 1990 and 2004 , the youth overall preferred Western popular music , even though it was banned by the government . Iranian underground rock bands are composed of members who are young , urban - minded , educated , relatively well - off , and global beings . Iranian rock is described by the traits that these band members possess . The youth who take part in underground music in the Middle East are aware of the social constraints of their countries , but they are not optimistic about social change . Iranian rock bands have taken up an internationalist position to express their rebellion from the discourses in their national governments . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Music radio </Li> <Li> Popular culture </Li> <Li> List of popular music performers </Li> <Li> List of popular music genres </Li> <Li> Popular music pedagogy </Li> <Li> List of honorific titles in popular music </Li> <Li> Music popularity index </Li> <Li> Volume ! </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Popular Music .

Three singles were released from the album , with two of them making the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 .

The Rolling Stone review of the album by Kit Rachlis stated that the album is one of the best to come out of 1976 - 77 , that Seger sounds like Rod Stewart and writes lyrics like Bruce Springsteen , and that album is classic rock and roll . The only problem that Rachlis had with the album was the production not being strong enough . A later review of the album by Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic says that the album was very similar to Beautiful Loser ( 1975 ) , but Night Moves is harder than Beautiful Loser . Erlewine also feels that the album has a wide range of styles and has not lost any of its influence years later . </P> <H2> In popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song `` Night Moves '' was featured in the video game Grand Theft Auto V on the fictional radio station Los Santos Rock Radio . </P> <P> An alternate recording of `` Night Moves '' was also featured in the 1981 film American Pop . </P> <P> `` Night Moves '' was used in an episode of Supernatural in which Sam and Dean sing along to the radio . </P> <P> `` The Fire Down Below '' was covered by Tina Turner on her 1978 album Rough .

Players began using the double bass in jazz in the 1890s to supply the low - pitched walking basslines that outlined the chord progressions of the songs . From the 1920s and 1930s Swing and big band era , through 1940s Bebop and 1950s Hard Bop , to the 1960s - era `` free jazz '' movement , the resonant , woody sound of the double bass anchored everything from small jazz combos to large jazz big bands . </P> <P> Beginning in the early 1950s , some jazz bass players began to use the electric bass guitar in place of the double bass . The electric bass , which was easier to amplify to loud volumes onstage , gained particular prominence in the late 1960s and early 1970s jazz subgenre which blended jazz with the powerfully amplified electric instruments of rock music , creating jazz fusion . </P> <P> Most jazz bassists specialize in either the double bass or the electric bass , although the ability to `` double '' ( play both instruments ) is common . A small number of players , such as Stanley Clarke and John Patitucci , have achieved virtuoso skill on both instruments . Whether a jazz bassist is `` comping '' ( accompanying ) with a walking bassline or soloing , or playing on a double bass or an electric bass , they usually aim to create a rhythmic drive and `` timefeel '' that creates a sense of swing and groove . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Double bass <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Playing techniques </Li> <Li> 1.2 Variants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Electric bass <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Fretted and fretless basses </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Alternative instruments </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Further reading </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> </Ul> <H2> Double bass ( edit ) </H2> <P> Beginning around 1890 , the African - American communities in early New Orleans used a jazz ensemble which played a mixture of marches , ragtime , and dixieland music . This ensemble was initially a marching band with sousaphone ( or occasionally bass saxophone ) supplying the bass line . As the music moved from playing for funerals on the street and into bars and brothels , the double bass gradually replaced these wind instruments . Many early bassists doubled on both the `` brass bass '' and `` string bass , '' as the instruments were then often referred to . Bassists played `` walking '' basslines -- scale - based lines that outlined the harmony and provided a foundation for the tunes . </P> <P> Because an unamplified double bass is generally the quietest instrument in a jazz band , many players of the 1920s and 1930s used the slap style , slapping and pulling the strings to make a rhythmic `` slap '' sound against the fingerboard . The slap style cuts through the sound of a band better than simply plucking the strings , and make the bass more easily heard on early sound recordings , as the recording equipment of that time did not capture low frequencies well . For more about the slap style , see `` Playing styles , '' below . </P> <P> Double bass players who have contributed to the evolution of jazz include the Swing era player Jimmy Blanton , who played with Duke Ellington , and Oscar Pettiford , who pioneered the instrument 's soloistic use in Bebop . The `` cool '' style of jazz was influenced by players such as Scott LaFaro and Percy Heath , whose solos were very melodic . </P> <P> Paul Chambers ( who worked with Miles Davis on the famous Kind of Blue album ) achieved renown for being one of the early jazz bassists to play Bebop solos in arco ( bowed ) style . The first player known to do that was Slam Stewart , who would scat in octaves with his bowed bass in his solos , good examples of which can be found on the trio recordings he made with Art Tatum and Tiny Grimes . Ron Carter ( another bassist who worked with Miles Davis in his second great quintet ) , is credited as a key figure of the modern school of jazz bass playing . He is one of the most - recorded bassists in jazz . </P> <P> Free jazz was influenced by the composer / bassist Charles Mingus ( who also contributed to hard bop ) and Charlie Haden , best known for his work with Ornette Coleman . In the 1950s , some big band bandleaders began to ask their upright players to use the then - newly available Fender bass , the first widely available electric bass . In the 1970s , as jazz and rock music were blended by performers to create the `` fusion '' genre , players such as Jaco Pastorius began to develop a unique sound using the electric bass . </P> <P> Apart from jazz fusion and Latin - influenced jazz , the double bass is still widely used in jazz in the 2010s . The deep sound and woody tone of the plucked double bass is distinct from the sound of the fretted bass guitar . The bass guitar produces a different sound than the double bass , because its strings are usually stopped with the aid of metal frets . As well , bass guitars usually have a solid wood body , which means that the sound is produced by electronic amplification of the vibration of the strings . The solid body upright , also known as a `` stick '' bass or `` EUB '' variation is still widely used by bass players in salsa and timba bands , because its sound is so well suited to those styles . The EUB is smaller and lighter than a double bass , making touring and travelling easier , and its solid ( or mostly solid ) body enables bassists to play at a much higher volume with a bass amp without feedback . </P> <H3> Playing techniques ( edit ) </H3> <P> In jazz , since the 1950s , the double bass is usually played with amplification and it is mostly played with the fingers , pizzicato style , except during some solos , where players may use the bow . The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres . Some players perform with the sides of one , two , or three fingers , especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads , because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone . Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast - moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for quiet tunes . </P> An example of pizzicato jazz bass technique . <P> Using amplification gives the player more control over the tone of the instrument , because amplifiers have equalization controls that can accentuate certain frequencies ( often the bass frequencies ) while de-accentuating some frequencies ( often the high frequencies , so that there is less finger noise ) . While jazz double bass players use amplification , they typically use much smaller , lower - powered bass amplifiers and smaller speaker cabinets than those used by an electric bass player playing in a jazz fusion show . An upright player performing at a small club may only bring a 1x12 '' combo amp to the gig . When a small jazz combo is playing in a small jazz club , the double bass player may use only a modest amount of amplification , so that the audience is hearing a mixture of the natural acoustic tone and the amplified sound . Of course , if that same band plays on a huge jazz festival mainstage , all of the bass tone reaching the audience 's ears will be from the sound reinforcement system . </P> <P> An unamplified acoustic bass ' tone is limited by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument 's hollow body , which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches . With an amplifier and equalization devices , a bass player can boost the low frequencies , which evens out the frequency response . As well , the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument , which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with long held notes . Like other acoustic instruments used with amplification , such as the jazz violin , a double bass is often plugged into a preamplifier , impedance - matching device , and / or a Direct Injection ( DI box ) box before it is routed to the PA system , electronic effects , or the bass instrument amplifier . </P> <P> In traditional jazz and swing it is sometimes played in the slap style . This is a vigorous version of pizzicato where the strings are `` slapped '' against the fingerboard between the main notes of the bass line , producing a snare drum - like percussive sound . The main notes are either played normally or by pulling the string away from the fingerboard and releasing it so that it bounces off the fingerboard , producing a distinctive percussive attack in addition to the expected pitch . Notable slap style bass players , whose use of the technique was often highly syncopated and virtuosic , sometimes interpolate two , or even three more slaps in between notes of their bass line . </P> <H3> Variants ( edit ) </H3> A five - string Electric Upright Bass ( `` EUB '' ) <P> In both jazz and jazz fusion bands , some jazz bassists use a modified type of double bass called the electric upright bass ( abbreviated EUB and sometimes also called stick bass ) . The stick bass is also widely used in salsa , because its volume and tone are especially suited to that style of music , even in studio recording . It is an electronically amplified version of the double bass that has a minimal or ' skeleton ' body , which greatly reduces the size and weight of the instrument . The EUB retains enough of the features of the double bass so that double bass players are comfortable performing on it . While the EUB retains some of the tonal characteristics of the double bass , its electrically amplified nature also gives it its own unique sound . As well , an EUB is considerably easier to transport than its acoustic equivalent . The scale length of EUBs varies : some scales are 42 `` , similar to most double basses , whilst other models have scale lengths of only 30 '' like a short scale bass guitar . The shorter scale can make it easier for bass guitarists to convert to the EUB . </P> <P> Solid bodied EUBs produce very little sound without electronic amplification . Hollow - bodied EUBs produce a quiet tone that is loud enough for individual practice . However , since hollow - bodied EUBs do not have a large resonant cavity like a double bass , they can not reproduce the lowest notes of the instrument without an amplifier . To amplify the EUB , the string vibrations are sensed with a pickup . Early EUBs used magnetic pickups similar to those in electric guitars , or percussive magnetic diaghram pickups ( e.g. , the Ampeg `` Baby Bass '' ) . Many modern EUBs use piezoelectric pickups located in the bridge or a combination of pickup types . The signal from the pickup is usually preamplified and equalized with a preamplifier and then sent to a bass amplifier or a PA system . For silent practice in a hotel room or apartment , an EUB can also be connected to headphones . </P> <P> Preamplifiers and equalizers for acoustic instruments or double basses can also be used to `` roll off '' the treble frequencies or `` notch out '' the `` scratchy - sounding '' frequencies . Since the EUB typically does not have a hollow sound chamber , or only includes a small sound chamber , the EUB is less prone to audio feedback than the double bass when amplified . To use a bow with an EUB , both the bridge and fingerboard must be radiussed ( given a curve ) . EUBs are much easier to transport to gigs , or fly with on tours than a large , fragile double bass . </P> <H2> Electric bass ( edit ) </H2> Jaco Pastorius , performing with Weather Report in Convocation Hall , Toronto , Canada November 27 , 1977 <P> The electric bass is a relative newcomer to the world of jazz . Until the 1950s , the double bass was used to anchor jazz ensembles from small combos to huge big bands . The electric bass was introduced in the early 1950s when Roy Johnson ( and later Monk Montgomery ) first used the instrument in Lionel Hampton 's big band . When the electric bass is used in jazz , it has both an accompaniment and a soloing role . When the bass is used to accompany , it may be used to perform walking basslines for traditional tunes and jazz standards , in smooth quarter note lines that imitate the sound of the double bass . </P> <P> The electric bass player can play all of the same types of bass lines played by her upright bass cousin . However , due to the design of the electric bass as a guitar - family instrument , it is possible to play rapid bass lines that would be impossible on an upright bass . For example , an electric bassist in a fusion or Latin band can play a bassline composed entirely of rapid , syncopated sixteenth notes . For Latin or salsa tunes and rock - infused jazz fusion tunes , the electric bass may play challenging , fast - moving rhythmic figures in coordination with the drummer , or lay down a low , heavy groove . </P> <P> In a fusion band , electric bass players have to provide a solid , heavy bass foundation for the band while a drummer , electric guitarist ( amplified through a guitar amp ) and synthesizer or electric piano player performing ( amplified through a keyboard amp ) are all playing . As well , fusion bands are more likely to play a rock - size venue , such as a large club or theatre , than a small jazz club . To provide a good bass sound , a fusion electric bass player will often use a powerful bass amplifier and a larger speaker cabinet than an upright player would use , such as a 4X10 '' cabinet , or even two 4X10 '' cabinets . </P> <P> In a jazz setting , the electric bass tends to have much a much more expansive solo role than in most popular styles . In most rock settings , the bass guitarist may only have a few short bass breaks or brief solos during a concert . During a jazz concert , a jazz bassist may have a number of lengthy improvised solos , which are called `` blowing '' in jazz parlance . Among those who have spearheaded the bass guitar in jazz are Jaco Pastorius , Victor Wooten , and Marcus Miller . </P> <H3> Fretted and fretless basses ( edit ) </H3> Jack Bruce playing a fretless Warwick Thumb bass at the Jazzfestival Frankfurt , Germany 28 October 2006 <P> One of the options for bass guitarists is whether to use an instrument with frets on the fingerboard or not . On a fretted bass , metal frets divide the fingerboard into semitone divisions ( as on a guitar ) . The original Fender basses had 20 frets , but modern basses may have 24 or more . Fretless basses have a distinct sound , because the absence of frets means that the string must be pressed down directly onto the wood of the fingerboard as with the double bass . The string buzzes against the wood and is somewhat muted because the sounding portion of the string is in direct contact with the flesh of the player 's finger . The fretless bass allows players to use the expressive devices of glissando , vibrato and microtonal intonations such as quarter tones and just intonation . </P> <P> In a small combo , the bass player may alone determine which type of bass to use and for which tunes . In a band with a bandleader , the leader may provide guidance on what tunes are best suited to each type of bass . Some bassists use both fretted and fretless basses in performances , according to the type of material they are performing . While fretless basses are often associated with jazz and jazz fusion , bassists from other genres use fretless basses , such as metal bassist Steve DiGiorgio . </P> Fretless basses are often used by jazz fusion bass guitar players ; this fretless bass has flatwound strings ; note the markers inlaid into the side of the fingerboard , to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch . <P> Bill Wyman takes credit for creating the first fretless bass guitar in 1961 when he converted an inexpensive Japanese fretted bass by removing the frets . The first production fretless bass was the Ampeg AUB - 1 introduced in 1966 , and Fender introduced a fretless Precision Bass in 1970 . In the early 1970s , fusion - jazz bassist Jaco Pastorius created his own fretless bass by removing the frets from a Fender Jazz Bass , filling the holes with wood putty , and coating the fretboard with epoxy resin . </P> <P> Pastorius used epoxy rather than varnish to obtain a glass - like finish suitable for the use of roundwound strings , which are otherwise much harder on the wood of the fingerboard . Some fretless basses have `` fret line '' markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide , while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck . Tapewound ( double bass type ) and flatwound strings are sometimes used with the fretless bass so that the metal string windings do not wear down the fingerboard . Some fretless basses have epoxy - coated fingerboards to increase durability , enhance sustain , and give a brighter tone . Though most fretless basses have four strings , five - string and six - string fretless basses are also available . Fretless basses with more than six strings are also available as `` boutique '' or custom - made instruments . </P> <H2> Alternative instruments ( edit ) </H2> <P> While the majority of jazz and jazz fusion recordings and live performances use either the double bass ( or a related instrument such as an electric upright bass ) or the electric bass to supply the `` low end '' , there are some exceptions . In jazz organ trios , a Hammond organ player performs the basslines using the bass pedalboard or their lower manual , along with a drummer and a saxophonist . In some jazz fusion groups , the basslines may be played by a keyboard player on a bass synthesizer or other keyboard . As well , in some duos and other small groups , the basslines may be provided by a piano player ; in a duo consisting of a jazz pianist and a jazz singer , the piano player plays a bassline with the left hand and chords in the right hand underneath the singer 's voice . Similarly , in some duos or trios , a jazz guitarist may play basslines , a role that is especially feasible if the guitarist has a seven - string guitar with a low `` B '' string . In traditional Dixieland or New Orleans - style jazz groups , the basslines may be played by a tuba or other low brass instrument . </P> Bassist - composer Esperanza Spalding performing on December 10 , 2009 at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert . <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : http://www.musicradar.com/news/bass/the-history-of-the-electric-bass-part-1-early-days-507234 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Historic Jazz Fotos </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Roberts , Jim ( 2001 ) .

      "    \"text\": \"Earth 's energy budget - wikipedia <H1> Earth 's energy budget </H1> Earth 's climate is largely determined by the planet 's energy budget , i.e. , the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation . It is measured by satellites and shown in W / m . <P> Earth 's energy budget accounts for the balance between the energy Earth receives from the Sun , the energy Earth radiates back into outer space after having been distributed throughout the five components of Earth 's climate system and having thus powered the so - called Earth 's heat engine . This system is made up of earth 's water , ice , atmosphere , rocky crust , and all living things . </P> <P> Quantifying changes in these amounts is required to accurately model the Earth 's climate . </P> Play media Incoming , top - of - atmosphere ( TOA ) shortwave flux radiation , shows energy received from the sun ( Jan 26 -- 27 , 2012 ) . Play media Outgoing , longwave flux radiation at the top - of - atmosphere ( Jan 26 -- 27 , 2012 ) . Heat energy radiated from Earth ( in watts per square metre ) is shown in shades of yellow , red , blue and white . The brightest - yellow areas are the hottest and are emitting the most energy out to space , while the dark blue areas and the bright white clouds are much colder , emitting the least energy . <P> Received radiation is unevenly distributed over the planet , because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions . The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through evaporation of surface water , convection , rainfall , winds , and ocean circulation . Earth is very close to being in radiative equilibrium , the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space ; under that condition , global temperatures will be relatively stable . Globally , over the course of the year , the Earth system -- land surfaces , oceans , and atmosphere -- absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter . Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response . </P> <P> However , Earth 's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors , such as atmospheric composition ( mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases ) , the albedo ( reflectivity ) of surface properties , cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns . </P> <P> Changes in surface temperature due to Earth 's energy budget do not occur instantaneously , due to the inertia of the oceans and the cryosphere .

Called the albedo of Earth , around 35 units are reflected back to space : 27 from the top of clouds , 2 from snow and ice - covered areas , and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere . The 65 remaining units are absorbed : 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth 's surface . These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation : 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere ( 19 through latent heat of condensation , 9 via convection and turbulence , and 6 directly absorbed ) . The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere ( 34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation ) are finally radiated back to space . These 65 units ( 17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere ) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth . </P> <H3> Incoming radiant energy ( shortwave ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The total amount of energy received per second at the top of Earth 's atmosphere ( TOA ) is measured in watts and is given by the solar constant times the cross-sectional area of the Earth . Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere ( i.e. the area of a circle ) , the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340 W / m2 . Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal , seasonal and annual variations , the numbers quoted are long - term averages , typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements . </P> <P> Of the ~ 340 W / m2 of solar radiation received by the Earth , an average of ~ 77 W / m2 is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~ 23 W / m2 is reflected by the surface albedo , leaving ~ 240 W / m2 of solar energy input to the Earth 's energy budget . This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29 . </P> <H3> Earth 's internal heat and other small effects ( edit ) </H3> <P> The geothermal heat flux from the Earth 's interior is estimated to be 47 terawatts . This comes to 0.087 watt / square metre , which represents only 0.027 % of Earth 's total energy budget at the surface , which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming solar radiation . </P> <P> Human production of energy is even lower , at an estimated 18 TW . </P> <P> Photosynthesis has a larger effect : photosynthetic efficiency turns up to 2 % of incoming sunlight into biomass , for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~ 1500 -- 2250 TW ( ~ 1 % + / - 0.26 % solar energy hitting the Earth 's surface ) . </P> <P> Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations , including accretion of interplanetary dust and solar wind , light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space . Earlier , Joseph Fourier had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the greenhouse effect . </P> <H3> Longwave radiation ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Outgoing longwave radiation <P> Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing infrared energy leaving the planet . However , the atmosphere absorbs parts initially , or cloud cover can reflect radiation . Generally , heat energy is transported between the planet 's surface layers ( land and ocean ) to the atmosphere , transported via evapotranspiration and latent heat fluxes or conduction / convection processes . Ultimately , energy is radiated in the form of longwave infrared radiation back into space . </P> <P> Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation , which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation ( the latent heat flux ) , offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface . </P> <H2> Earth 's energy imbalance ( edit ) </H2> <P> If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux , net heat is added to or lost by the planet ( if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively ) . </P> <H3> Indirect measurement ( edit ) </H3> <P> An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling ( depending on the direction of the imbalance ) , and the ocean being the larger thermal reservoir on Earth , is a prime candidate for measurements . </P> <P> Earth 's energy imbalance measurements provided by Argo floats have detected an accumulation of ocean heat content ( OHC ) . The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep solar minimum of 2005 -- 2010 to be 0.58 \\u00b1 0.15 W / m2 . This level of detail can not be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes , which have combined uncertainties of the order of \\u00b1 17 W / m2 . </P> <H3> Direct measurement ( edit ) </H3> <P> Several satellites indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance . The NASA Earth Radiation Budget Experiment ( ERBE ) project involves three such satellites : the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite ( ERBS ) , launched October 1984 ; NOAA - 9 , launched December 1984 ; and NOAA - 10 , launched September 1986 . </P> <P> Today NASA 's satellite instruments , provided by CERES , part of the NASA 's Earth Observing System ( EOS ) , are designed to measure both solar - reflected and Earth - emitted radiation . </P> <H2> Natural greenhouse effect ( edit ) </H2> Diagram showing the energy budget of Earth 's atmosphere , which includes the greenhouse effect See also : Greenhouse effect <P> The major atmospheric gases ( oxygen and nitrogen ) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ( infrared ) radiation . However , water vapor , carbon dioxide , methane and other trace gases are opaque to many wavelengths of thermal radiation . The Earth 's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming solar energy in the form of thermal infrared . However , the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy . The remaining fraction , 5 to 6 percent , is absorbed by the atmosphere by greenhouse gas molecules . </P> Atmospheric gases only absorb some wavelengths of energy but are transparent to others . The absorption patterns of water vapor ( blue peaks ) and carbon dioxide ( pink peaks ) overlap in some wavelengths . Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor , but it absorbs energy in wavelengths ( 12 -- 15 micrometres ) that water vapor does not , partially closing the `` window '' through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space . ( Illustration NASA , Robert Rohde ) <P> When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy , their temperature rises . Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions . Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules ; those molecules also absorb the heat , and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases . The atmosphere thins with altitude , and at roughly 5 -- 6 kilometres , the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space . </P> <P> Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions , some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth 's surface , where it is absorbed . The Earth 's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating . This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect . It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation ( sunlight ) to enter , but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves . </P> <H2> Climate sensitivity ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Radiative forcing <P> A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a radiative forcing . </P> <P> Climate sensitivity is the steady state change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget . </P> <H3> Climate forcings and global warming ( edit ) </H3> Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing . Measured imbalance , close to 0.6 W / m2 , implies that aerosol forcing is close to \\u2212 1.6 W / m2 . ( Credit : NASA / GISS ) <P> Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall , disrupting the energy balance . Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun 's brightness , Milankovitch cycles ( small variations in the shape of Earth 's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years ) and volcanic eruptions that inject light - reflecting particles as high as the stratosphere . Man - made forcings include particle pollution ( aerosols ) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight ; deforestation , which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight ; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases , which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space . </P> <P> A forcing can trigger feedbacks that intensify ( positive feedback ) or weaken ( negative feedback ) the original forcing . For example , loss of ice at the poles , which makes them less reflective , causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts , is an example of a positive feedback . </P> <P> The observed planetary energy imbalance during the recent solar minimum shows that solar forcing of climate , although natural and significant , is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing . </P> <P> In 2012 , NASA scientists reported that to stop global warming atmospheric CO content would have to be reduced to 350 ppm or less , assuming all other climate forcings were fixed . The impact of anthropogenic aerosols has not been quantified , but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Planetary equilibrium temperature </Li> <Li> Clouds and the Earth 's Radiant Energy System </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` The NASA Earth 's Energy Budget Poster '' .

They can be categorized in a number of ways . The Western terms `` scripture '' and `` canonical '' are applied to Buddhism in inconsistent ways by Western scholars : for example , one authority refers to `` scriptures and other canonical texts '' , while another says that scriptures can be categorized into canonical , commentarial and pseudo-canonical . Buddhist traditions have generally divided these texts with their own categories and divisions , such as that between buddhavacana `` word of the Buddha , '' many of which are known as `` sutras , '' and other texts , such as shastras ( treatises ) or Abhidharma . </P> <P> These religious texts were written in many different languages and scripts but memorizing , reciting and copying the texts were of high value .

The Mah\\u0101s\\u0101\\u1e43ghika and the M\\u016blasarv\\u0101stiv\\u0101da considered both the Buddha 's discourses , and of his disciples , to be buddhavacana . A number of different beings such as buddhas , disciples of the buddha , \\u1e5b\\u1e63is , and devas were considered capable to transmitting buddhavacana . The content of such a discourse was then to be collated with the s\\u016btras , compared with the Vinaya , and evaluated against the nature of the Dharma . These texts may then be certified as true buddhavacana by a buddha , a sa\\u1e43gha , a small group of elders , or one knowledgeable elder . </P> <H3> In Theravada Buddhism ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Theravada Buddhism , the standard collection of buddhavacana is the P\\u0101li Canon . </P> <P> Some scholars believe that some portions of the Pali Canon and Agamas could contain the actual substance of the historical teachings ( and possibly even the words ) of the Buddha . </P> <H3> In East Asian Buddhism ( edit ) </H3> <P> In East Asian Buddhism , what is considered buddhavacana is collected in the Chinese Buddhist canon . The most common edition of this is the Taish\\u014d Tripi\\u1e6daka . </P> <P> According to Venerable Hsuan Hua from the tradition of Chinese Buddhism , there are five types of beings who may speak the sutras of Buddhism : a buddha , a disciple of a buddha , a deva , a \\u1e5b\\u1e63i , or an emanation of one of these beings ; however , they must first receive certification from a buddha that its contents are true Dharma . Then these sutras may be properly regarded as buddhavacana . </P> <P> Sometimes texts that are considered commentaries by some are regarded by others as Buddhavacana . </P> <P> Shingon Buddhism developed a system that assigned authorship of the early sutras to Gautama Buddha in his physical manifestation , of the Ekayana sutras to the Buddhas as Sambhoghakaya , and the Vajrayana texts to the Buddha as Dharmakaya . </P> <H3> In Tibetan Buddhism ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Tibetan Buddhism , what is considered buddhavacana is collected in the Kangyur . The East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist canons always combined Buddhavacana with other literature in their standard collected editions . However , the general view of what is and is not buddhavacana is broadly similar between East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism . The Tibetan Kangyur , which belongs to the various schools of Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism , in addition to containing sutras and vinaya , also contains tantras . </P> <H2> Textual traditions ( edit ) </H2> Map showing the three major Buddhist divisions <P> The earliest Buddhist texts were passed down orally in Middle Indo - Aryan languages called Prakrits , including G\\u0101ndh\\u0101r\\u012b language , the early Magadhan language and Pali through the use of repetition , communal recitation and mnemonic devices . Doctrinal elaborations were preserved in Abhidharma works and later Karikas ( verse expositions ) . As Buddhism spread geographically , these texts were translated into the local language , such as Chinese and Tibetan . </P> <P> The Pali canon was preserved in Sri Lanka where it was first written down in the first century BCE and the Theravadan Pali textual tradition developed there . The Sri Lankan Pali tradition developed extensive commentaries ( Atthakatha ) as well as sub-commentaries for the Pali Canon as well as treatises on Abhidhamma . Sutra commentaries and Abhidharma works also exist in Tibetan , Chinese , Korean and other East Asian languages . Important examples of non-canonical Pali texts are the Visuddhimagga , by Buddhaghosa , which is a compendium of Theravada teachings and the Mahavamsa , a historical Sri Lankan chronicle . </P> <P> The earliest known Buddhist manuscripts , recovered from the ancient civilization of Gandhara in north central Pakistan ( near Taxila just south west of the capital Islamabad ) are dated to the 1st century and constitute the Buddhist textual tradition of Gandharan Buddhism which was an important link between Indian and East Asian Buddhism . </P> <P> After the rise of the Kushans in India , Sanskrit was also widely used to record Buddhist texts . Sanskrit Buddhist literature later became the dominant tradition in India until the decline of Buddhism in India . Around the beginning of the Christian era , a new genre of sutra literature began to be written with a focus on the Bodhisattva idea , commonly known as Mahayana ( great vehicle ) sutras . Many of the Mahayana sutras were written in Sanskrit and then translated into the Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist canons ( the Kangyur and the Taish\\u014d Tripi\\u1e6daka respectively ) which then developed their own textual histories . The Mahayana sutras are traditionally considered by Mahayanists to be the word of the Buddha , but transmitted either in secret , via lineages of supernatural beings ( such as the nagas ) , or revealed directly from other Buddhas or bodhisattvas . Some 600 Mahayana Sutras have survived in Sanskrit , or in Chinese and / or Tibetan translation . </P> Korean Koryo Period Sutra Page <P> In the Mahayana tradition there are important works termed Shastras , or treatises which attempt to outline the sutra teachings and defend or expand on them . The works of important Buddhist philosophers like Nagarjuna , Vasubandhu and Dharmakirti are generally termed Shastras , and were written in Sanskrit . The treatise Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana ( attributed by the faithful to A\\u015bvagho\\u015fa ) strongly influenced east Asian Mahayana doctrine and inspired numerous commentaries authored by early Korean and Chinese Buddhist teachers . </P> <P> The late Seventh century saw the rise of another new class of Buddhist texts , the Tantras , which outlined new ritual practices and yogic techniques such as the use of Mandalas , Mudras and Fire sacrifices . Buddhist Tantras are key texts in Vajrayana Buddhism , which is the dominant form of Buddhism in Tibet . </P> <P> The division of texts into the traditional three yanas may obscure the process of development that went on , and there is some overlap in the traditional classifications . For instance , there are so - called proto - Mahayana texts , such as the Ajitasena Sutra , which are missing key features that are associated with Mahayana texts . Some Pali texts also contain ideas that later became synonymous with the Mahayana . The Garbh\\u0101vakr\\u0101nti S\\u016btra is included in both the Vinaya Pitaka of the Mulasarvastivada , one of the early schools , and the Ratnakuta , a standard collection of Mahayana sutras . Some Mahayana texts are also thought to display a distinctly tantric character , particularly some of the shorter Perfection of Wisdom sutras . An early tantra , the Mahavairocana Abhisambodhi Tantra , is also known as the Mahavairocana Sutra . At least some editions of the Kangyur include the Heart Sutra in the tantra division . Such overlap is not confined to `` neighbouring '' yanas : at least nine `` Sravakayana '' ( `` Hinayana '' ) texts can be found in the tantra divisions of some editions of the Kangyur . One of them , the Atanatiya Sutra , is also included in the Mikkyo ( esoteric ) division of the standard modern collected edition of Sino - Japanese Buddhist literature . ( A variant of it is also found in the Digha Nikaya of the Pali Canon . ) </P> <P> Some Buddhist texts evolved to become a virtual canon in themselves , and are referred to as vaipulya or extensive sutras . The Flower Garland Sutra is an example of a single sutra made up of other sutras , many of which , particularly the Gandavyuha Sutra still circulate as separate texts . </P> <P> Tibetan Buddhism has a unique and special class of texts called terma ( Tibetan : gTer - ma ) . These are texts ( or ritual objects , etc . ) believed either composed or hidden by tantric masters and / or elementally secreted or encoded in the elements and retrieved , accessed or rediscovered by other tantric masters when appropriate . Termas are discovered by tert\\u00f6ns ( Tibetan : gTer - stons ) , whose special function is to reveal these texts . Some termas are hidden in caves or similar places , but a few are said to be ' mind termas , ' which are ' discovered ' in the mind of the tert\\u00f6n . The Nyingma school ( and B\\u00f6n tradition ) has a large terma literature . Many of the terma texts are said to have been written by Padmasambhava , who is particularly important to the Nyingmas . Probably the best known terma text is the so - called Tibetan book of the dead , the Bardo Thodol . </P> <H2> Texts of the early schools ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

The other ( parts of ) extant versions of the Tripitakas of early schools include the \\u0100gamas , which includes texts by the Sarvastivada and the Dharmaguptaka . The Chinese Buddhist canon contains a complete collection of early sutras in Chinese translation , their content is very similar to the Pali , differing in detail but not in the core doctrinal content . </P> <P> Parts of what is likely to be the canon of the Dharmaguptaka can be found amongst the Gandharan Buddhist Texts . Several early versions of the Vinaya Pitaka ( from various schools ) are also kept in the Chinese ( Mahayana ) Canon . </P> <H3> Vinaya ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Vinaya <P> The vinaya literature is primarily concerned with aspects of the monastic discipline . However , vinaya as a term is also contrasted with Dharma , where the pair ( Dhamma - Vinaya ) mean something like ' doctrine and discipline ' . The vinaya literature in fact contains a considerable range of texts . There are , of course , those that discuss the monastic rules , how they came about , how they developed , and how they were applied . But the vinaya also contains some doctrinal expositions , ritual and liturgical texts , biographical stories , and some elements of the `` Jatakas '' , or birth stories . </P> <P> Paradoxically , the text most closely associated with the vinaya , and the most frequently used portion of it , the Pratimoksha , is in itself not a canonical text in Theravada , even though almost all of it can be found in the canon . </P> <P> Six complete vinayas survive : </P> <Ul> <Li> Theravada , written in Pali </Li> <Li> Mula - Sarv\\u0101stiv\\u0101da , written in Sanskrit , but surviving complete only in Tibetan translation </Li> <Li> Mah\\u0101s\\u0101nghika , Sarv\\u0101stiv\\u0101da , Mah\\u012bsh\\u0101sika , and Dharmagupta , originally in Indian languages , but only surviving in Chinese translation . </Li> </Ul> <P> In addition , portions survive of a number of vinayas in various languages . </P> <P> The Mah\\u0101vastu compiled by the Lokottaravadin sub-school of the Mah\\u0101s\\u0101nghika was perhaps originally the preamble to their vinaya that became detached ; hence , rather than dealing with the rules themselves , it takes the form of an extended biography of the Buddha , which it describes in terms of his progression through ten bhumis , or stages . This doctrine was later taken up by the Mahayana in a modified form as Vasubandhu 's Ten Stages Sutra . </P> <H3> Sutra ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Sutras ( Sanskrit ; Pali Sutta ) are mostly discourses attributed to the Buddha or one of his close disciples . They are all , even those not actually spoken by him , considered to be Buddhavacana , the word of the Buddha , just as in the case of all canonical literature . The Buddha 's discourses were perhaps originally organised according to the style in which they were delivered . There were originally nine , but later twelve , of these . The Sanskrit forms are : </P> <Ul> <Li> S\\u016btra : prose discourses , especially short declarative discourses . </Li> <Li> Geya : mixed prose and verse discourse . Identified with the Sag\\u0101th\\u0101vagga of the Sa\\u1e41yutta Nik\\u0101ya </Li> <Li> Vy\\u0101karana : explanation , analysis . Discourses in question and answer format . </Li> <Li> G\\u0101th\\u0101 : verse </Li> <Li> Ud\\u0101na : inspired speech </Li> <Li> Ityukta : beginning with ' thus has the Bhagavan said ' </Li> <Li> J\\u0101taka : story of previous life </Li> <Li> Abhutadharma : concerning wonders and miraculous events </Li> <Li> Vaipulya either ' extended discourses ' or ' those giving joy ' ( cf Mahayana Texts ) </Li> <Li> Nid\\u0101na : in which the teachings are set within their circumstances of origin </Li> <Li> Avad\\u0101na : tales of exploits </Li> <Li> Upadesha : defined and considered instructions </Li> </Ul> <P> The first nine are listed in all surviving agamas , with the other three added in some later sources . In Theravada , at least , they are regarded as a classification of the whole of the scriptures , not just suttas . The scheme is also found in Mahayana texts . However , some time later a new organizational scheme was imposed on the canon , which is now the most familiar . The scheme organises the suttas into : </P> Long discourses ( edit ) <P> These range in length up to 95 pages . The Pali Digha Nikaya contains 34 texts , including the Mah\\u0101parinibb\\u0101na Sutta and the Brahmaj\\u0101la Sutta . The D\\u012brgh\\u0101gama of the Dharmagupta also survives , in Chinese translation , and contains 30 sutras . </P> Medium - length discourses ( edit ) <P> These are the rest of the sutras of any length , and the Pali Majjhima Nikaya has 152 suttas . The Madhyam\\u0101gama of the Sarv\\u0101stivada containing 222 sutras survives in Chinese translation . </P> Connected discourses ( edit ) <P> This grouping consists of many short texts connected by theme , setting , or interlocutor . The Pali Samyutta Nikaya contains more than 2,800 sutras . The Samyukt\\u0101gama of the Sarv\\u0101stivada containing only 1,300 sutras survives in Chinese translation . </P> Numbered discourses ( edit ) <P> Sutras with the same number of doctrinal items , comprise over 2,300 suttas in the Pali Anguttara Nikaya . The Chinese canon contains an Ekottar\\u0101gama that some scholars think belongs to the Mah\\u0101sanghika school . </P> Miscellaneous texts ( edit ) <P> Not all schools had this category , but the Pali Khuddaka Nikaya has several well - known and loved texts , including : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Dhammapada : a collection of sayings and aphorisms . </Li> <Li> The Udana : a collection of inspired sayings in verse usually with a prose introduction that sets a context of sorts for the saying . </Li> <Li> The Sutta Nipata : parts of the Sutta Nipata , such as the A\\u1e6d\\u1e6dhakavagga and P\\u0101r\\u0101yanavagga , are thought by some scholars to represent the earliest strata of the written canon . Many of the features of later texts , such as numbered lists of teachings , or complex doctrinal categories , are not present . </Li> <Li> Therag\\u0101th\\u0101 and Ther\\u012bg\\u0101th\\u0101 two collections of biographical verse related to the disciples of the Buddha . </Li> <Li> Jataka : poems related to the so - called ' birth stories , ' which recount former lives of the Buddha . These remain popular in many forms of Buddhism . </Li> </Ul> <P> Many of these texts are available in translation as well as in the original language . The Dhammapada , for instance , has a Pali version , three Chinese versions , a Tibetan version , and a Khotanese version . </P> <H3> Abhidharma ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Abhidharma <P> Abhidharma ( in Pali , Abhidhamma ) means ' further Dharma ' and is concerned with the analysis of phenomena . It grew initially out of various lists of teachings such as the 37 Bodhipaksika - dharmas or the 37 Factors leading to Awakening . The Abhidharma literature is chiefly concerned with the analysis of phenomena and the relationships between them . </P> <P> The Therav\\u0101da Abhidhamma survives in the Pali Canon . Outside of the Theravada monasteries the Pali Abhidharma texts are not well known . </P> <P> A Sarvastivada Abhidharma , composed in Sanskrit , survives in Chinese and Tibetan traditions . Though the Therav\\u0101din Abhidhamma is well preserved and best known , it should be noted that a number of the early Eighteen Schools each had their own distinct Abhidharma collection with not very much common textual material , though sharing methodology . </P> <P> Not all schools accepted the Abhidharma as canonical . The Sautr\\u0101ntika , for instance , held that the canon stopped with the vinaya and sutras . The rejection by some schools that dharmas ( i.e. phenomena ) are ultimately real , which the Theravada Abhidhamma , for instance , insists , is thought to be an important factor in the origin of the Mahayana . </P> <H3> Other texts ( edit ) </H3> <P> One early text not usually regarded as Buddhavacana is probably the Milinda pa\\u00f1ha ( literally The Questions of Milinda ) . This text is in the form of a dialogue between Nagasena , and the Indo - Greek King Menander ( Pali : Milinda ) . It is a compendium of doctrine , and covers a range of subjects . It is included in some editions of the Pali Canon . </P> <P> Other early texts which are usually not considered ' canonical ' are the Nettipakarana and the Petakopadesa - `` The Book of Guidance '' and `` Instruction on the Pitaka '' . </P> <P> The Dhy\\u0101na sutras ( Chan - jing ) are a group of early Buddhist meditation texts which contain meditation teachings from the Sarvastivada school along with some early proto - Mahayana meditations . They were mostly the work of Buddhist Yoga teachers from Kashmir and were influential in Chinese Buddhism . </P> <P> The Buddhist poet A\\u015bvagho\\u1e63a composed an epic poem on the life of the Buddha called the Buddhacarita in the early second century CE . </P> <H2> Texts in the Theravada tradition ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Pali literature Burmese - Pali manuscript copy of the Buddhist text Mahaniddesa , showing three different types of Burmese script , ( top ) medium square , ( centre ) round and ( bottom ) outline round in red lacquer from the inside of one of the gilded covers <P> The Pali texts have an extensive commentarial literature much of which is still untranslated . These are attributed to scholars working in Sri Lanka such as Buddhaghosa ( 5th century CE ) and Dhammapala . There are also sub-commentaries ( tikka ) or commentaries on the commentaries . Buddhaghosa was also the author of the Visuddhimagga , or Path of Purification , which is a manual of doctrine and practice according to the Mahavihara tradition of Sri Lanka and according to Nanamoli Bhikkhu is regarded as `` the principal non-canonical authority of the Theravada . '' A similar albeit shorter work is the Vimuttimagga . Another highly influential Pali Theravada work is the Abhidhammattha - sangaha ( 11th or 12th century ) , a short introductory summary to the Abhidhamma . </P> <P> Buddhaghosa is known to have worked from Buddhist commentaries in the Sri Lankan Sinhala language , which are now lost . Sri Lankan literature in the vernacular contains many Buddhist works , including as classical Sinhala poems such as the Muvadev\\u0101vata ( The Story of the Bodhisattva 's Birth as King Mukhadeva , 12th century ) and the Sasad\\u0101vata ( The Story of the Bodhisattva 's Birth as a Hare , 12th century ) as well as prose works like the Dhampiy\\u0101tuv\\u0101 g\\u00e4tapadaya ( Commentary on the Blessed Doctrine ) , a commentary on words and phrases in the P\\u0101li Dhammapada . </P> <P> The Pali textual tradition spread into Burma and Thailand where Pali scholarship continued to flourish with such works as the Aggavamsa of Saddaniti and the Jinakalamali of Ratanapa\\u00f1\\u00f1a . Pali literature continued to be composed into the modern era , especially in Burma , and writers such as Mahasi Sayadaw translated some of their texts into Pali . </P> <P> There are numerous Tantric Theravada texts , mostly from Southeast Asia . This tradition flourished in Cambodia and Thailand before the 19th century reformist movement of Rama IV . One of these texts has been published in English by the Pali Text Society as `` Manual of a Mystic '' . </P> <P> Burmese Buddhist literature developed unique poetic forms form the 1450s onwards , a major type of poetry is the pyui ' long and embellished translations of Pali Buddhist works , mainly jatakas . A famous example of pyui ' poetry is the Kui khan pyui ' ( the pyui ' in nine sections , 1523 ) . Burmese commentaries or nissayas and were used to teach Pali . The nineteenth century saw a flowering of Burmese Buddhist literature in various genres including religious biography , Abhidharma , legal literature and meditation literature . </P> <P> An influential text of Thai literature is the `` Three Worlds According to King Ruang '' ( 1345 ) by Phya Lithai , which is an extensive Cosmological and visionary survey of the Thai Buddhist universe . </P> <H2> Mahayana texts ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

Biblioth\\u00e8que nationale de France <H3> Perfection of Wisdom texts ( edit ) </H3> <P> These deal with praj\\u00f1\\u0101 ( wisdom or insight ) . Wisdom in this context means the ability to see reality as it truly is . They do not contain an elaborate philosophical argument , but simply try to point to the true nature of reality , especially through the use of paradox . The basic premise is a radical non-dualism , in which every and any dichotomist way of seeing things is denied : so phenomena are neither existent , nor non-existent , but are marked by sunyata , emptiness , an absence of any essential unchanging nature . The Perfection of Wisdom in One Letter illustrates this approach by choosing to represent the perfection of praj\\u00f1\\u0101 with the Sanskrit / Pali short a vowel ( `` \\u0905 '' , pronounced ( \\u0259 ) ) -- which , as a prefix , negates a word 's meaning ( e.g. , changing svabhava to asvabhava , `` with essence '' to `` without essence '' ; cf . mu ) , which is the first letter of Indic alphabets ; and that , as a sound on its own , is the most neutral / basic of speech sounds ( cf Aum and bija ) . </P> <P> Many sutras are known by the number of lines , or slokas , that they contained . </P> <P> Edward Conze , who translated nearly all of the Perfection of Wisdom sutras into English , identified four periods of development in this literature : </P> <Ol> <Li> 100 BCE - 100 CE : Ratnagunasamcayagatha and the Astasaharika ( 8,000 lines ) </Li> <Li> 100 - 300 CE : a period of elaboration in which versions in 18,000 , 25,000 , and 100,000 lines are produced .

Probably composed in its earliest form in the period 100 bce -- 100 ce , the sutra proposes that the three yanas ( Shravakayana , Pratyekabuddhayana , and Bodhisattvayana ) are not in fact three different paths leading to three goals , but one path , with one goal . The earlier teachings are said to be of ' skillful means ' in order to help beings of limited capacities . Notable for the ( re ) appearance of the Buddha Prabhutaratna , who had died several aeons earlier , because it suggests that a Buddha is not inaccessible after his parinirvana , and also that his life - span is said to be inconceivably long because of the accumulation of merit in past lives . This idea , though not necessarily from this source , forms the basis of the later Trikaya doctrine . Later associated particularly with the Tien Tai in China , Tendai school in Japan , and the Nichiren schools in Japan . </P> <H3> Pure Land sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are three major sutras that fall into this category : the Infinite Life Sutra , also known as the Larger Pure Land Sutra ; the Amitabha Sutra , also known as the Smaller Pure Land Sutra ; and the Contemplation Sutra ( also known as the Visualization Sutra ) . These texts describe the origins and nature of the Western Pure Land in which the Buddha Amitabha resides . They list the forty - eight vows made by Amitabha as a bodhisattva by which he undertook to build a Pure Land where beings are able to practise the Dharma without difficulty or distraction . The sutras state that beings can be reborn there by pure conduct and by practices such as thinking continuously of Amitabha , praising him , recounting his virtues , and chanting his name . These Pure Land sutras and the practices they recommend became the foundations of Pure Land Buddhism , which focus on the salvific power of faith in the vows of Amitabha . </P> <H3> The Vimalakirti nirdesha Sutra ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Vimalakirti Sutra <P> Composed in its earliest form some time before 150 CE , the Bodhisattva Vimalakirti appears in the guise of a layman in order to teach the Dharma . Seen by some as a strong assertion of the value of lay practice . Doctrinally similar to the Perfection of Wisdom texts , a major theme is the Buddhafield ( Buddha - kshetra ) , which was influential on Pure Land schools . Very popular in China , Korea and Japan where it was seen as being compatible with Confucian values . </P> <H3> Samadhi sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> Amongst the very earliest Mahayana texts , the Samadhi Sutras are a collection of sutras focused on the attainment of profound states of consciousness reached in meditation , perhaps suggesting that meditation played an important role in early Mahayana . Includes the Pratyutpanna Sutra and the Shurangama Samadhi Sutra . </P> <H3> Confession sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Triskandha Sutra , and the Suvarnaprabhasa Sutra ( or Golden Light Sutra ) , which focus on the practice of confession of faults . The Golden Light Sutra became especially influential in Japan , where one of its chapters on the ' Universal Sovereign ' ( Sanskrit : Chakravartin ) was used by the Japanese emperors to legitimise their rule , and it provided a model for a well - run state . </P> <H3> The Avatamsaka Sutra ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Avatamsaka Sutra <P> A large composite text consisting of several parts , most notably the Dasabhumika Sutra and the Gandavyuha Sutra . It exists in three successive versions , two in Chinese and one in Tibetan . New sutras were added to the collection in both the intervals between these . The Gandavyuha Sutra is thought to be the source of a sect that was dedicated specifically to Vairocana , and that later gave rise to the Mahavairocana - abhisambodhi tantra . The Mahavairocana - abhisambodhi became one of the two central texts in Shingon Buddhism and was included in the Tibetan canon as a tantra of the carya class . The Avatamsaka Sutra became the central text for the Hua - yen ( Jp . Kegon ) school of Buddhism , the most important doctrine of which is the interpenetration of all phenomena . </P> <H3> Third turning sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> These sutras primarily teach the doctrine of vijnapti - matra or ' representation - only ' , associated with the Yogacara school . The Sandhinirmocana Sutra ( c 2nd Century CE ) is the earliest surviving sutra in this class ( and according to some Gelugpa authorities the only one ) . This sutra divides the teachings of the Buddha into three classes , which it calls the `` Three Turnings of the Wheel of the Dharma . '' To the first turning , it ascribes the Agamas of the Shravakas , to the second turning the lower Mahayana sutras including the Prajna - paramita Sutras , and finally sutras like itself are deemed to comprise the third turning . Moreover , the first two turnings are considered , in this system of classification , to be provisional while the third group is said to present the final truth without a need for further explication ( nitartha ) . </P> <H3> Tathagatagarbha class sutras ( edit ) </H3> See also : Tathagatagarbha doctrine <P> Especially the Tathagatagarbha Sutra , the Shr\\u012bm\\u0101l\\u0101devi - simhan\\u0101da S\\u016btra ( Srimala Sutra ) , the Angulimaliya Sutra , the Anunatva - Apurnatva - Nirdesa Sutra , and the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra ( which differs in character from the Pali Mahaparinibbana Sutta ) . These texts teach that every being has a Tathagatagarbha : variously translated as Buddha nature , Buddha seed , Buddha matrix . It is this Buddha nature , Buddha Essence or Buddha Principle , this aspect of every being that is itself already enlightened , that enables beings to be liberated . One of the most important responses of Buddhism to the problem of immanence and transcendence . The Tathagatagarbha doctrine was very influential in East Asian Buddhism , and the idea in one form or another can be found in most of its schools . The well - known Lankavatara Sutra , composed sometime around the 4th century , is sometimes included in thevijnapti - matra group associated with the Yogacara teachings , however D.T. Suzuki sees the Lankavatara as clearly pre-dating and distinguished from Yogacara . The Lankavatara teaches cittamatra ( mind only ) not that of vijnaptimatra of the Yogacara . Also , central to the Lankavatara is the identity of the alayavjnana with the tathagata - garbha and the Lankavatara 's central message that the tathagata - garbha is what makes possible the turning inward ( paravritti or paravrtti ) of awareness to realize the Buddha 's psychological transformation in practical life , while the tathagata - garbha system was unknown or ignored by the progenitors of the Yogacara system . The Lankavatara Sutra was influential in the Chan or Zen schools . </P> <H3> Collected sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> These are two large sutras , which are actually collections of other sutras . The Mah\\u0101ratnak\\u016bta S\\u016btra contains 49 individual works , and the Mah\\u0101samnip\\u0101ta S\\u016btra is a collection of 17 shorter works . Both seem to have been finalised by about the 5th century , although some parts of them are considerably older . </P> <H3> Transmigration sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> These include a number of sutras that focus on actions that lead to existence in the various spheres of existence , or that expound the doctrine of the twelve links of pratitya - samutpada or dependent - origination . </P> <H3> Discipline sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> These focus on the principles that guide the behaviour of Bodhisattvas . They include the K\\u0101shyapa - parivarta , the Bodhisattva - pr\\u0101timoksa S\\u016btra , and the ( ( Brahmajala Sutra ) ) . </P> <H3> Sutras devoted to individual figures ( edit ) </H3> <P> This is a large number of sutras that describe the nature and virtues of a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva and / or their Pure Land , including Ma\\u00f1jusri , Ksitigarbha , the Buddha Akshobhya , and Bhaishajyaguru also known as the Medicine Buddha . </P> <H3> Proto - Mahayana sutras ( edit ) </H3> <P> Early in the 20th Century , a cache of texts was found in a mound near Gilgit , Afghanistan . Among them was the Ajitasena Sutra . The Ajitasena Sutra appears to be a mixture of Mahayana and pre-Mahayana ideas . It occurs in a world where monasticism is the norm , which is typical of the Pali Suttas ; there is none of the usual antagonism towards the Shravakas ( also called the Hinayana ) or the notion of Arahantship , which is typical of Mahayana Sutras such as the White Lotus , or Vimalakirti Nirdesha . However , the sutra also has an Arahant seeing all the Buddha fields , it is said that reciting the name of the sutra will save beings from suffering and the hell realms , and a meditative practice is described that allows the practitioner to see with the eyes of a Buddha , and to receive teachings from them that are very much typical of Mahayana Sutras . </P> <H3> Non-buddhavacana texts ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Mahayana commentarial and exegetical literature is vast . Many commentarial texts are called Shastras , a by - word used when referring to a scripture . Extending this meaning , the shastra is commonly used to mean a treatise or text written in explanation of some idea , especially in matters involving religion . In Buddhism , a shastra is often a commentary written at a later date to explain an earlier scripture or sutra . </P> <P> The M\\u016blamadhyamika - karik\\u0101 , or Root Verses on the Middle Way , by Nagarjuna is a seminal text on the Madhyamika philosophy , shares much of the same subject matter as the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras , although it is not strict a commentary on them . </P> <P> The 9th Century Indian Buddhist Shantideva produced two texts : the Bodhicary\\u0101vat\\u0101ra has been a strong influence in many schools of the Mahayana . It is notably a favorite text of the fourteenth Dalai Lama . The text begins with an elaborate ritual worship section , but goes on to expound the six perfections . The 9th chapter is a critique of various views on perfect wisdom from the Madhyamika point of view . Shantideva also produced the Shikshasamuccaya , which is a compendium of doctrines from a huge range of Mahayana Sutras -- some of which no longer exist and therefore are known only through his quotes . </P> <P> Asanga , associated with the Yogacara school of Mahayana thought , is said to have received many texts directly from the Bodhisattva Maitreya in the Tushita god realm , including Madhy\\u0101ntavibh\\u0101ga , the Mah\\u0101y\\u0101na - s\\u016btr\\u0101lam\\u0101ra , and the Abhisamay\\u0101lamkara . He is also said to have personally written the Mah\\u0101y\\u0101na - samgraha , the Abhidharma - samuccaya ( a compendium of Abhidharma thought that became the standard text for many Mahayana schools especially in Tibet ) , and the Yog\\u0101c\\u0101ra - bh\\u016bmi ( although the latter text appears to have had several authors . ) </P> <P> Asanga 's brother Vasubandhu wrote a large number of texts associated with the Yogacara including : Trivabh\\u0101va - nirdesha , Vimshatika , Trimshika , and the Abhidharmako\\u015ba - bh\\u0101sya although this work predates his conversion to the Mahayana and a minority of scholars speculate that there may have been two different Vasubandhus who composed these works . Most influential in the East Asian Buddhist tradition was probably his Thirty Verses on Consciousness - only . </P> <P> Dign\\u0101ga is associated with a school of Buddhist logic that tried to establish which texts were valid sources of knowledge ( see also Epistemology ) . He produced the Pram\\u0101na - samuccaya , and later Dharmakirti wrote the Pram\\u0101na - v\\u0101rttik\\u0101 , which was a commentary and reworking of the Dignaga text . </P> <P> The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana attributed to Ashvaghosha was influential in East Asian Buddhism , especially the Hua - yen school of China , and its Japanese equivalent , Kegon . Ashvaghosha is also celebrated for his plays . </P> <H3> East Asian works ( edit ) </H3> The Tripi\\u1e6daka Koreana , an early edition of the Chinese Buddhist canon <P> The early period of the development of Chinese Buddhism was concerned with the collection and translation of texts into Chinese and the creation of the Chinese Buddhist canon . This was often done by traveling overland to India , as recorded in the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions , by the monk Xuanzang . East Asian Buddhism began to develop its own unique literature with the rise of the Tiantai School and its major representative , Zhiyi ( 538 -- 597 CE ) who wrote important commentaries on the Lotus sutra as well as the first major comprehensive work on meditation composed in China , the Mohe Zhiguan ( \\u6469 \\u8a36 \\u6b62\\u89b3 ) . Another important school of Chinese Buddhism is Huayan , which focused on developing their philosophical texts from the Avatamsaka Sutra . An important patriarch of this school is Fazang who wrote many commentaries and treatises . </P> <P> Zen Buddhism developed a large literary tradition based on the teachings and sayings of Chinese Zen masters . One of the key texts in this genre is the Platform Sutra attributed to Zen patriarch Huineng , it gives an autobiographical account of his succession as Ch'an Patriarch , as well as teachings about Ch'an theory and practice . Other texts are Koan collections , which are compilations of the sayings of Chinese masters such as the Blue Cliff Record and The Gateless Gate . Another key genre is that of compilations of Zen master biographies , such as the Transmission of the Lamp . Buddhist poetry was also an important contribution to the literature of the tradition . </P> <P> After the arrival of Chinese Buddhism in Japan , Korea and Vietnam ; they developed their own traditions and literature in the local language . </P> <H2> Vajrayana texts ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

The upper book cover shows the images of four of the Eight Medicine Buddhas . <H3> Buddhist tantras ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Buddhist Tantras <P> The Tibetan Buddhist canon includes a number of Nikaya - related texts from the Mula - Sarvastivada school , as well as Mahayana sutras . However , it is the specifically Vajrayana texts that most strongly characterise it . They are considered to be the word of the Buddha ( Buddhavacana ) , and the Tibetan Kangyur contains translations of almost 500 tantras . The texts are typically concerned with elaborate rituals and meditations . </P> <P> A late Tibetan tradition has made a fourfold classification into : </P> Kriy\\u0101 Tantras ( edit ) <P> Kriy\\u0101 tantras . These form a large subgroup that appeared between the 2nd and 6th centuries . The Kriya tantras focus on ritual actions . Each centres on a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva , and many are based on dharanis . Examples include the Mah\\u0101megha Sutra , the \\u0100rya - ma\\u00f1jushr\\u012b - m\\u016bla - kalpa , the Subh\\u0101hu - pariprcch\\u0101 Sutra , and the Aparimit\\u0101yur - j\\u00f1\\u0101na - hrdaya - dh\\u0101ran\\u012b . Also included in this category are some Mahayana texts such as the Heart Sutra and , in some editions , versions of some texts found in the Pali Canon . </P> Charya tantras ( edit ) <P> Carya tantras . This is a small class of texts that probably emerged after the 6th century and are entirely centred on the worship of the Buddha Vairocana . The best known example is the Mah\\u0101 - vairocan\\u0101bhisambodhi Tantra , also known as the Mahavairocana Sutra , which became a foundational text for the Shingon School of Japan . </P> Yoga tantras ( edit ) <P> Yoga tantras likewise focus on Vairocana , and include the Sarva - tath\\u0101gata - tattva - samgraha Tantra and the Sarva - durgati - parishodhana Tantra . The Shurangama Sutra and the Shurangama Mantra from which it ( called the Shitatapatra Ushnisha Dharani ) comes can be included in this category . According to Venerable Tripitaka Master Bhikshu Shramana Hsuan Hua 's `` Shurangama Mantra Commentary '' ( Buddhist Text Translation Society of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas , 1981 , Volume 1 ) , the Shurangama Mantra mystically and literally includes all of the Buddha Dharma in its entirety , and its focus is on the Five Dhyana Buddhas ( Vairochana , Amitabha ) , Akshobhya , Ratnasambhava , and Amoghasiddhi , with stress on Vairochana and Ashobhya Buddhas ) and their retinues of Dharmapalas and wrathful deities in male and female forms , such as Vajrapani , wrathful Manjushri , Mahakala , Tara , Pandaravasini , Prakruti , Uchushma Fire Head Vajra , Brahma , Indra , Shiva as Rudra , Raudri - Umapati form of Vajrayogini , Narayana , Ganapati , various Dhakinis , Naga kings , Yaksha kings , Rakshasha kings , and many other Dharma Protectors of the Buddhist Pantheon and Vedic pantheon . The primary wrathful Goddess of the Shurangamma Mantra tantric practice is the Great White Umbrella Deity form of Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva , an important practice in Tibetan Buddhism . </P> Anuttara tantras ( edit ) <P> Anuttara tantras . The most advanced class of tantra is the Anuttarayoga tantra , which focus on mental transformation and less on ritual actions . These are sometimes further divided into the so - called Father Tantras and Mother Tantras . </P> <Ul> <Li> First there are the yogottara , or higher union , tantras , also known as father tantras , or skilful means , ( Sanskrit : up\\u0101ya ) tantras . They focus on the Buddha Akshobhya and his consort M\\u0101maki . The Guhya - sam\\u0101ja Tantra comes from this class of tantras , dating probably from the 8th century . </Li> <Li> Secondly praj\\u00f1a or mother tantras , also known as yogini tantras , dating from the late 8th century . Akshobhya is still the central figure , but he now appears in his wrathful form as Heruka . Female figures take on a much greater significance , becoming as important as male figures , if not more so . The Samvara Tantra was translated into Tibetan in the 8th century . Other members of this class , such as the Hevajra Tantra , appeared in the 10th century . </Li> <Li> The Kalachakra tantra is sometimes said to be an advaya or non-dual tantra . It appeared very late in the development of tantric Buddhism - in the mid-11th century - and is written in classical Sanskrit , rather than the usual mixture of Prakrit and the characteristic `` allusive speech '' of twilight language , ( Sanskrit : samdhy\\u0101bh\\u0101sh\\u0101 ) . For the first time the teachings refer to the \\u0101dhibuddha , or primordial Buddha . </Li> </Ul> <P> Anuttaratantra is known in the Nyingma school as Mahayoga . This school also has a collection of tantras of its own , not found in the other Tibetan schools . </P> <P> Textual evidence suggests that some of these texts are in fact Shaivite Tantras adopted and adapted to Buddhist purposes , and many similarities in iconography and ritual can be seen in them . </P> <H3> Other products of the Vajrayana literature ( edit ) </H3> <P> A sadhana is a tantric spiritual practices text used by practitioners , primarily to practice the mandala or a particular yidam , or meditation deity . The S\\u0101dhanam\\u0101l\\u0101 is a collection of sadhanas . </P> <P> Vajrayana adepts , known as mahasiddha , often expounded their teachings in the form of songs of realization . Collections of these songs such as the Cary\\u0101g\\u012bti , or the Charyapada are still in existence . The Dohakosha is a collection of doha songs by the yogi Saraha from the 9th century . A collection known in English as The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa was composed by Tibetan Buddhist yogi Milarepa and is especially popular amongst members of the Kagyu school . </P> <P> Terma are Tibetan Buddhist texts , hidden to be rediscovered at a later date . Padmasambhava and Yeshe Tsogyal wrote and hid most termas , although texts have also been hidden by figures such as Machig Labdron . The best known terma text is probably the Bardo thodol , or ' Awakening in the Bardo State ' , also known as the Tibetan Book of the Dead . The person who finds a terma text is known as a terton . </P> <P> The Blue Annals ( Standard Tibetan : deb ther sngon po ) completed in 1476CE , authored by G\\u00f6lo Zh\\u00f6nnupel ( Tibetan : gos lo gzhon nu dpal , 1392 -- 1481 ) , is a historical survey of Tibetan Buddhism with a marked ecumenical view , focusing upon the dissemination of various sectarian traditions throughout Tibet . </P> <P> Namtar , or spiritual biographies , are another popular form of Tibetan Buddhist texts , whereby the teachings and spiritual path of a practitioner are explained through a review of their lifestory . </P> <P> K\\u016bkai wrote a number of treatises on Vajrayana Buddhism that are distinct from his Shingon Buddhism . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Abhidharma Pitaka </Li> <Li> \\u0100gama ( Buddhism ) </Li> <Li> Buddhavacana </Li> <Li> Chinese Buddhist canon </Li> <Li> Gandharan Buddhist Texts , the earliest known Buddhist manuscripts </Li> <Li> List of historic Indian texts </Li> <Li> List of suttas </Li> <Li> Mahayana Sutras </Li> <Li> Pali Canon </Li> <Li> Sutra </Li> <Li> Sutta Pitaka </Li> <Li> Tibetan Buddhist canon </Li> <Li> Timeline of Buddhism </Li> <Li> Tripi\\u1e6daka Koreana </Li> <Li> Vinaya Pitaka </Li> <Li> Sanskrit Buddhist literature </Li> <Li> Yana , Buddhist schools into `` yanas '' or `` vehicles '' </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` It is therefore possible that much of what is found in the Sutta Pitaka is earlier than c. 250 BCE , perhaps even more than 100 years older than this .

      "    \"long_answer\": \"<P> Buddhist texts were initially passed on orally by monks , but were later written down and composed as manuscripts in various Indo - Aryan languages which were then translated into other local languages as Buddhism spread . They can be categorized in a number of ways . The Western terms `` scripture '' and `` canonical '' are applied to Buddhism in inconsistent ways by Western scholars : for example , one authority refers to `` scriptures and other canonical texts '' , while another says that scriptures can be categorized into canonical , commentarial and pseudo-canonical . Buddhist traditions have generally divided these texts with their own categories and divisions , such as that between buddhavacana `` word of the Buddha , '' many of which are known as `` sutras , '' and other texts , such as shastras ( treatises ) or Abhidharma . </P>\",\n",

The three main purposes of metabolism are the conversion of food / fuel to energy to run cellular processes , the conversion of food / fuel to building blocks for proteins , lipids , nucleic acids , and some carbohydrates , and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes . These enzyme - catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow and reproduce , maintain their structures , and respond to their environments . The word metabolism can also refer to the sum of all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms , including digestion and the transport of substances into and between different cells , in which case the set of reactions within the cells is called intermediary or intermediate metabolism . </P> <P> The two subcategories of metabolism are catabolism - the breaking down of compounds ; for example , the breaking down of glucose to pyruvate by cellular respiration ; and anabolism - the building up ( synthesis ) of compounds such as proteins , carbohydrates , lipids , and nucleic acids . Usually , breaking down releases energy and building up consumes energy . </P> <P> The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways , in which one chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical , by a sequence of enzymes . Enzymes are crucial to metabolism because they allow organisms to drive desirable reactions that require energy that will not occur by themselves , by coupling them to spontaneous reactions that release energy . Enzymes act as catalysts that allow the reactions to proceed more rapidly . Enzymes also allow the regulation of metabolic pathways in response to changes in the cell 's environment or to signals from other cells . </P> <P> The metabolic system of a particular organism determines which substances it will find nutritious and which poisonous . For example , some prokaryotes use hydrogen sulfide as a nutrient , yet this gas is poisonous to animals . The speed of metabolism , the metabolic rate , influences how much food an organism will require , and also affects how it is able to obtain that food . </P> <P> A striking feature of metabolism is the similarity of the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species . For example , the set of carboxylic acids that are best known as the intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms , being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants . These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history , and their retention because of their efficacy . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Key biochemicals <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Amino acids and proteins </Li> <Li> 1.2 Lipids </Li> <Li> 1.3 Carbohydrates </Li> <Li> 1.4 Nucleotides </Li> <Li> 1.5 Coenzymes </Li> <Li> 1.6 Minerals and cofactors </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Catabolism <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Digestion </Li> <Li> 2.2 Energy from organic compounds </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Energy transformations <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Oxidative phosphorylation </Li> <Li> 3.2 Energy from inorganic compounds </Li> <Li> 3.3 Energy from light </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Anabolism <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Carbon fixation </Li> <Li> 4.2 Carbohydrates and glycans </Li> <Li> 4.3 Fatty acids , isoprenoids and steroids </Li> <Li> 4.4 Proteins </Li> <Li> 4.5 Nucleotide synthesis and salvage </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Xenobiotics and redox metabolism </Li> <Li> 6 Thermodynamics of living organisms </Li> <Li> 7 Regulation and control </Li> <Li> 8 Evolution </Li> <Li> 9 Investigation and manipulation </Li> <Li> 10 History </Li> <Li> 11 See also </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 Further reading </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Key biochemicals ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Biomolecule , Cell ( biology ) , and Biochemistry Structure of a triacylglycerol lipid This is a diagram depicting a large set of human metabolic pathways . <P> Most of the structures that make up animals , plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule : amino acids , carbohydrates and lipids ( often called fats ) . As these molecules are vital for life , metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues , or by breaking them down and using them as a source of energy , by their digestion . These biochemicals can be joined together to make polymers such as DNA and proteins , essential macromolecules of life . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Type of molecule </Th> <Th> Name of monomer forms </Th> <Th> Name of polymer forms </Th> <Th> Examples of polymer forms </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Amino acids </Td> <Td> Amino acids </Td> <Td> Proteins ( made of polypeptides ) </Td> <Td> Fibrous proteins and globular proteins </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Carbohydrates </Td> <Td> Monosaccharides </Td> <Td> Polysaccharides </Td> <Td> Starch , glycogen and cellulose </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Nucleic acids </Td> <Td> Nucleotides </Td> <Td> Polynucleotides </Td> <Td> DNA and RNA </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Amino acids and proteins ( edit ) </H3> <P> Proteins are made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain joined together by peptide bonds . Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions in metabolism . Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions , such as those that form the cytoskeleton , a system of scaffolding that maintains the cell shape . Proteins are also important in cell signaling , immune responses , cell adhesion , active transport across membranes , and the cell cycle . Amino acids also contribute to cellular energy metabolism by providing a carbon source for entry into the citric acid cycle ( tricarboxylic acid cycle ) , especially when a primary source of energy , such as glucose , is scarce , or when cells undergo metabolic stress . </P> <H3> Lipids ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lipids are the most diverse group of biochemicals . Their main structural uses are as part of biological membranes both internal and external , such as the cell membrane , or as a source of energy . Lipids are usually defined as hydrophobic or amphipathic biological molecules but will dissolve in organic solvents such as benzene or chloroform . The fats are a large group of compounds that contain fatty acids and glycerol ; a glycerol molecule attached to three fatty acid esters is called a triacylglyceride . Several variations on this basic structure exist , including alternate backbones such as sphingosine in the sphingolipids , and hydrophilic groups such as phosphate as in phospholipids . Steroids such as cholesterol are another major class of lipids . </P> <H3> Carbohydrates ( edit ) </H3> Glucose can exist in both a straight - chain and ring form . <P> Carbohydrates are aldehydes or ketones , with many hydroxyl groups attached , that can exist as straight chains or rings . Carbohydrates are the most abundant biological molecules , and fill numerous roles , such as the storage and transport of energy ( starch , glycogen ) and structural components ( cellulose in plants , chitin in animals ) . The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose , fructose , and most importantly glucose . Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways . </P> <H3> Nucleotides ( edit ) </H3> <P> The two nucleic acids , DNA and RNA , are polymers of nucleotides . Each nucleotide is composed of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which is attached to a nitrogenous base . Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information , and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis . This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication . Many viruses have an RNA genome , such as HIV , which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome . RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions . Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar . These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen , classified as purines or pyrimidines . Nucleotides also act as coenzymes in metabolic - group - transfer reactions . </P> <H3> Coenzymes ( edit ) </H3> Structure of the coenzyme acetyl - CoA. The transferable acetyl group is bonded to the sulfur atom at the extreme left . Main article : Coenzyme <P> Metabolism involves a vast array of chemical reactions , but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules . This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions . These group - transfer intermediates are called coenzymes . Each class of group - transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme , which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it , and a set of enzymes that consume it . These coenzymes are therefore continuously made , consumed and then recycled . </P> <P> One central coenzyme is adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) , the universal energy currency of cells . This nucleotide is used to transfer chemical energy between different chemical reactions . There is only a small amount of ATP in cells , but as it is continuously regenerated , the human body can use about its own weight in ATP per day . ATP acts as a bridge between catabolism and anabolism . Catabolism breaks down molecules , and anabolism puts them together . Catabolic reactions generate ATP , and anabolic reactions consume it . It also serves as a carrier of phosphate groups in phosphorylation reactions . </P> <P> A vitamin is an organic compound needed in small quantities that can not be made in cells . In human nutrition , most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification ; for example , all water - soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) , a derivative of vitamin B ( niacin ) , is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor . Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD into NADH . This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell , NADH and NADPH . The NAD / NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions , while NADP / NADPH is used in anabolic reactions . </P> Structure of hemoglobin . The protein subunits are in red and blue , and the iron - containing heme groups in green . From PDB : 1GZX \\u200b . <H3> Minerals and cofactors ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Metal metabolism and Bioinorganic chemistry <P> Inorganic elements play critical roles in metabolism ; some are abundant ( e.g. sodium and potassium ) while others function at minute concentrations . About 99 % of a mammal 's mass is made up of the elements carbon , nitrogen , calcium , sodium , chlorine , potassium , hydrogen , phosphorus , oxygen and sulfur . Organic compounds ( proteins , lipids and carbohydrates ) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen ; most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water . </P> <P> The abundant inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes . The most important ions are sodium , potassium , calcium , magnesium , chloride , phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate . The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH . Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function , as action potentials in these tissues are produced by the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell 's fluid , the cytosol . Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels . For example , muscle contraction depends upon the movement of calcium , sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T - tubules . </P> <P> Transition metals are usually present as trace elements in organisms , with zinc and iron being most abundant of those . These metals are used in some proteins as cofactors and are essential for the activity of enzymes such as catalase and oxygen - carrier proteins such as hemoglobin . Metal cofactors are bound tightly to specific sites in proteins ; although enzyme cofactors can be modified during catalysis , they always return to their original state by the end of the reaction catalyzed . Metal micronutrients are taken up into organisms by specific transporters and bind to storage proteins such as ferritin or metallothionein when not in use . </P> <H2> Catabolism ( edit ) </H2> <P> Catabolism is the set of metabolic processes that break down large molecules . These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules . The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide the energy and components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules . The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism , and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon ( their primary nutritional groups ) , as shown in the table below . Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs , while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates , and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy . However , all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules , water , ammonia , hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen , nitrate or sulfate . In animals , these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules , such as carbon dioxide and water . In photosynthetic organisms , such as plants and cyanobacteria , these electron - transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight . </P> <Table> Classification of organisms based on their metabolism <Tr> <Td> Energy source </Td> <Td> sunlight </Td> <Td> photo - </Td> <Td_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> </Td> <Td> - troph </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Preformed molecules </Td> <Td> chemo - </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Electron donor </Td> <Td> organic compound </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> organo - </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> inorganic compound </Td> <Td> litho - </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Carbon source </Td> <Td> organic compound </Td> <Td_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> </Td> <Td> hetero - </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> inorganic compound </Td> <Td> auto - </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The most common set of catabolic reactions in animals can be separated into three main stages . In the first stage , large organic molecules , such as proteins , polysaccharides or lipids , are digested into their smaller components outside cells . Next , these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules , usually acetyl coenzyme A ( acetyl - CoA ) , which releases some energy . Finally , the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and carbon dioxide in the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain , releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD ) into NADH . </P> <H3> Digestion ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Digestion and Gastrointestinal tract <P> Macromolecules such as starch , cellulose or proteins can not be rapidly taken up by cells and must be broken into their smaller units before they can be used in cell metabolism . Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers . These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids , as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into simple sugars known as monosaccharides . </P> <P> Microbes simply secrete digestive enzymes into their surroundings , while animals only secrete these enzymes from specialized cells in their guts , including the stomach and pancreas , and salivary glands . The amino acids or sugars released by these extracellular enzymes are then pumped into cells by active transport proteins . </P> A simplified outline of the catabolism of proteins , carbohydrates and fats <H3> Energy from organic compounds ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Cellular respiration , Fermentation ( biochemistry ) , Carbohydrate catabolism , Fat catabolism , and Protein catabolism <P> Carbohydrate catabolism is the breakdown of carbohydrates into smaller units . Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides . Once inside , the major route of breakdown is glycolysis , where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated . Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways , but the majority is converted to acetyl - CoA through aerobic ( with oxygen ) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle . Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle , the most important product is NADH , which is made from NAD as the acetyl - CoA is oxidized . This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product . In anaerobic conditions , glycolysis produces lactate , through the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis . An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway , which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose , the sugar component of nucleic acids . </P> <P> Fats are catabolised by hydrolysis to free fatty acids and glycerol . The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are broken down by beta oxidation to release acetyl - CoA , which then is fed into the citric acid cycle . Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures . Steroids are also broken down by some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation , and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl - CoA , propionyl - CoA , and pyruvate , which can all be used by the cell for energy . M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon , and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway ( s ) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis . </P> <P> Amino acids are either used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules , or oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy . The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase . The amino group is fed into the urea cycle , leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton in the form of a keto acid . Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle , for example the deamination of glutamate forms \\u03b1 - ketoglutarate . The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose , through gluconeogenesis ( discussed below ) . </P> <H2> Energy transformations ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Oxidative phosphorylation ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Oxidative phosphorylation , Chemiosmosis , and Mitochondrion <P> In oxidative phosphorylation , the electrons removed from organic molecules in areas such as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP . This is done in eukaryotes by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron transport chain . In prokaryotes , these proteins are found in the cell 's inner membrane . These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane . </P> Mechanism of ATP synthase . ATP is shown in red , ADP and phosphate in pink and the rotating stalk subunit in black . <P> Pumping protons out of the mitochondria creates a proton concentration difference across the membrane and generates an electrochemical gradient . This force drives protons back into the mitochondrion through the base of an enzyme called ATP synthase . The flow of protons makes the stalk subunit rotate , causing the active site of the synthase domain to change shape and phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate -- turning it into ATP . </P> <H3> Energy from inorganic compounds ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Microbial metabolism and Nitrogen cycle <P> Chemolithotrophy is a type of metabolism found in prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds . These organisms can use hydrogen , reduced sulfur compounds ( such as sulfide , hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate ) , ferrous iron ( FeII ) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite . These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis , nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility . </P> <H3> Energy from light ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Phototroph , Photophosphorylation , and Chloroplast <P> The energy in sunlight is captured by plants , cyanobacteria , purple bacteria , green sulfur bacteria and some protists . This process is often coupled to the conversion of carbon dioxide into organic compounds , as part of photosynthesis , which is discussed below . The energy capture and carbon fixation systems can however operate separately in prokaryotes , as purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria can use sunlight as a source of energy , while switching between carbon fixation and the fermentation of organic compounds . </P> <P> In many organisms the capture of solar energy is similar in principle to oxidative phosphorylation , as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient . This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis . The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light - gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins . Reaction centers are classed into two types depending on the type of photosynthetic pigment present , with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type , while plants and cyanobacteria have two . </P> <P> In plants , algae , and cyanobacteria , photosystem II uses light energy to remove electrons from water , releasing oxygen as a waste product . The electrons then flow to the cytochrome b6f complex , which uses their energy to pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast . These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase , as before . The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP , for use in the Calvin cycle , which is discussed below , or recycled for further ATP generation . </P> <H2> Anabolism ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Anabolism <P> Anabolism is the set of constructive metabolic processes where the energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules . In general , the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step - by - step from small and simple precursors . Anabolism involves three basic stages . First , the production of precursors such as amino acids , monosaccharides , isoprenoids and nucleotides , secondly , their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP , and thirdly , the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins , polysaccharides , lipids and nucleic acids . </P> <P> Organisms differ according to the number of constructed molecules in their cells . Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water . Heterotrophs , on the other hand , require a source of more complex substances , such as monosaccharides and amino acids , to produce these complex molecules . Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy : photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light , whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions . </P> <H3> Carbon fixation ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Photosynthesis , Carbon fixation , and Chemosynthesis Plant cells ( bounded by purple walls ) filled with chloroplasts ( green ) , which are the site of photosynthesis <P> Photosynthesis is the synthesis of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide ( CO ) . In plants , cyanobacteria and algae , oxygenic photosynthesis splits water , with oxygen produced as a waste product . This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres , as described above , to convert CO into glycerate 3 - phosphate , which can then be converted into glucose . This carbon - fixation reaction is carried out by the enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin -- Benson cycle . Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants , C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis . These differ by the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle , with C3 plants fixing CO directly , while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO into other compounds first , as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions . </P> <P> In photosynthetic prokaryotes the mechanisms of carbon fixation are more diverse . Here , carbon dioxide can be fixed by the Calvin -- Benson cycle , a reversed citric acid cycle , or the carboxylation of acetyl - CoA . Prokaryotic chemoautotrophs also fix CO through the Calvin -- Benson cycle , but use energy from inorganic compounds to drive the reaction . </P> <H3> Carbohydrates and glycans ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Gluconeogenesis , Glyoxylate cycle , Glycogenesis , and Glycosylation <P> In carbohydrate anabolism , simple organic acids can be converted into monosaccharides such as glucose and then used to assemble polysaccharides such as starch . The generation of glucose from compounds like pyruvate , lactate , glycerol , glycerate 3 - phosphate and amino acids is called gluconeogenesis . Gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose - 6 - phosphate through a series of intermediates , many of which are shared with glycolysis . However , this pathway is not simply glycolysis run in reverse , as several steps are catalyzed by non-glycolytic enzymes . This is important as it allows the formation and breakdown of glucose to be regulated separately , and prevents both pathways from running simultaneously in a futile cycle . </P> <P> Although fat is a common way of storing energy , in vertebrates such as humans the fatty acids in these stores can not be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms can not convert acetyl - CoA into pyruvate ; plants do , but animals do not , have the necessary enzymatic machinery . As a result , after long - term starvation , vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that can not metabolize fatty acids . In other organisms such as plants and bacteria , this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle , which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl - CoA to oxaloacetate , where it can be used for the production of glucose . </P> <P> Polysaccharides and glycans are made by the sequential addition of monosaccharides by glycosyltransferase from a reactive sugar - phosphate donor such as uridine diphosphate glucose ( UDP - glucose ) to an acceptor hydroxyl group on the growing polysaccharide . As any of the hydroxyl groups on the ring of the substrate can be acceptors , the polysaccharides produced can have straight or branched structures . The polysaccharides produced can have structural or metabolic functions themselves , or be transferred to lipids and proteins by enzymes called oligosaccharyltransferases . </P> <H3> Fatty acids , isoprenoids and steroids ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Fatty acid synthesis and Steroid metabolism Simplified version of the steroid synthesis pathway with the intermediates isopentenyl pyrophosphate ( IPP ) , dimethylallyl pyrophosphate ( DMAPP ) , geranyl pyrophosphate ( GPP ) and squalene shown . Some intermediates are omitted for clarity . <P> Fatty acids are made by fatty acid synthases that polymerize and then reduce acetyl - CoA units . The acyl chains in the fatty acids are extended by a cycle of reactions that add the acyl group , reduce it to an alcohol , dehydrate it to an alkene group and then reduce it again to an alkane group . The enzymes of fatty acid biosynthesis are divided into two groups : in animals and fungi , all these fatty acid synthase reactions are carried out by a single multifunctional type I protein , while in plant plastids and bacteria separate type II enzymes perform each step in the pathway . </P> <P> Terpenes and isoprenoids are a large class of lipids that include the carotenoids and form the largest class of plant natural products . These compounds are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate . These precursors can be made in different ways . In animals and archaea , the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl - CoA , while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate as substrates . One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis . Here , the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol . Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol . </P> <H3> Proteins ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Protein biosynthesis and Amino acid synthesis <P> Organisms vary in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids . Most bacteria and plants can synthesize all twenty , but mammals can only synthesize eleven nonessential amino acids , so nine essential amino acids must be obtained from food . Some simple parasites , such as the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae , lack all amino acid synthesis and take their amino acids directly from their hosts . All amino acids are synthesized from intermediates in glycolysis , the citric acid cycle , or the pentose phosphate pathway . Nitrogen is provided by glutamate and glutamine . Amino acid synthesis depends on the formation of the appropriate alpha - keto acid , which is then transaminated to form an amino acid . </P> <P> Amino acids are made into proteins by being joined together in a chain of peptide bonds . Each different protein has a unique sequence of amino acid residues : this is its primary structure . Just as the letters of the alphabet can be combined to form an almost endless variety of words , amino acids can be linked in varying sequences to form a huge variety of proteins . Proteins are made from amino acids that have been activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond . This aminoacyl - tRNA precursor is produced in an ATP - dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase . This aminoacyl - tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome , which joins the amino acid onto the elongating protein chain , using the sequence information in a messenger RNA . </P> <H3> Nucleotide synthesis and salvage ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Nucleotide salvage , Pyrimidine biosynthesis , and Purine \\u00a7 Metabolism <P> Nucleotides are made from amino acids , carbon dioxide and formic acid in pathways that require large amounts of metabolic energy . Consequently , most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides . Purines are synthesized as nucleosides ( bases attached to ribose ) . Both adenine and guanine are made from the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate , which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine , glutamine , and aspartic acid , as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate . Pyrimidines , on the other hand , are synthesized from the base orotate , which is formed from glutamine and aspartate . </P> <H2> Xenobiotics and redox metabolism ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Xenobiotic metabolism , Drug metabolism , Alcohol metabolism , and Antioxidant <P> All organisms are constantly exposed to compounds that they can not use as foods and would be harmful if they accumulated in cells , as they have no metabolic function . These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics . Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs , natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified by a set of xenobiotic - metabolizing enzymes . In humans , these include cytochrome P450 oxidases , UDP - glucuronosyltransferases , and glutathione S - transferases . This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic ( phase I ) and then conjugate water - soluble groups onto the molecule ( phase II ) . The modified water - soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted ( phase III ) . In ecology , these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills . Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms , but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms , and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds . </P> <P> A related problem for aerobic organisms is oxidative stress . Here , processes including oxidative phosphorylation and the formation of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide . These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases . </P> <H2> Thermodynamics of living organisms ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Biological thermodynamics <P> Living organisms must obey the laws of thermodynamics , which describe the transfer of heat and work . The second law of thermodynamics states that in any closed system , the amount of entropy ( disorder ) can not decrease . Although living organisms ' amazing complexity appears to contradict this law , life is possible as all organisms are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings . Thus living systems are not in equilibrium , but instead are dissipative systems that maintain their state of high complexity by causing a larger increase in the entropy of their environments . The metabolism of a cell achieves this by coupling the spontaneous processes of catabolism to the non-spontaneous processes of anabolism . In thermodynamic terms , metabolism maintains order by creating disorder . </P> <H2> Regulation and control ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Metabolic pathway , Metabolic control analysis , Hormone , Regulatory enzymes , and Cell signaling <P> As the environments of most organisms are constantly changing , the reactions of metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells , a condition called homeostasis . Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments . Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled . Firstly , the regulation of an enzyme in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals . Secondly , the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway ( the flux through the pathway ) . For example , an enzyme may show large changes in activity ( i.e. it is highly regulated ) but if these changes have little effect on the flux of a metabolic pathway , then this enzyme is not involved in the control of the pathway . </P> Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism . Insulin binds to its receptor ( 1 ) , which in turn starts many protein activation cascades ( 2 ) . These include : translocation of Glut - 4 transporter to the plasma membrane and influx of glucose ( 3 ) , glycogen synthesis ( 4 ) , glycolysis ( 5 ) and fatty acid synthesis ( 6 ) . <P> There are multiple levels of metabolic regulation . In intrinsic regulation , the metabolic pathway self - regulates to respond to changes in the levels of substrates or products ; for example , a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate . This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway . Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells . These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface . These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins . </P> <P> A very well understood example of extrinsic control is the regulation of glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin . Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels . Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen . The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase , the enzyme that breaks down glycogen , and glycogen synthase , the enzyme that makes it . These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion , with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase , but activating phosphorylase . Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing a decrease in the phosphorylation of these enzymes . </P> <H2> Evolution ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Molecular evolution and Phylogenetics Evolutionary tree showing the common ancestry of organisms from all three domains of life . Bacteria are colored blue , eukaryotes red , and archaea green . Relative positions of some of the phyla included are shown around the tree . <P> The central pathways of metabolism described above , such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle , are present in all three domains of living things and were present in the last universal common ancestor . This universal ancestral cell was prokaryotic and probably a methanogen that had extensive amino acid , nucleotide , carbohydrate and lipid metabolism . The retention of these ancient pathways during later evolution may be the result of these reactions having been an optimal solution to their particular metabolic problems , with pathways such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle producing their end products highly efficiently and in a minimal number of steps . The first pathways of enzyme - based metabolism may have been parts of purine nucleotide metabolism , while previous metabolic pathways were a part of the ancient RNA world . </P> <P> Many models have been proposed to describe the mechanisms by which novel metabolic pathways evolve . These include the sequential addition of novel enzymes to a short ancestral pathway , the duplication and then divergence of entire pathways as well as the recruitment of pre-existing enzymes and their assembly into a novel reaction pathway . The relative importance of these mechanisms is unclear , but genomic studies have shown that enzymes in a pathway are likely to have a shared ancestry , suggesting that many pathways have evolved in a step - by - step fashion with novel functions created from pre-existing steps in the pathway . An alternative model comes from studies that trace the evolution of proteins ' structures in metabolic networks , this has suggested that enzymes are pervasively recruited , borrowing enzymes to perform similar functions in different metabolic pathways ( evident in the MANET database ) These recruitment processes result in an evolutionary enzymatic mosaic . A third possibility is that some parts of metabolism might exist as `` modules '' that can be reused in different pathways and perform similar functions on different molecules . </P> <P> As well as the evolution of new metabolic pathways , evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions . For example , in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids , nucleotides and carbohydrates may instead be scavenged from the host . Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms . </P> <H2> Investigation and manipulation ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Protein methods , Proteomics , Metabolomics , and Metabolic network modelling Metabolic network of the Arabidopsis thaliana citric acid cycle . Enzymes and metabolites are shown as red squares and the interactions between them as black lines . <P> Classically , metabolism is studied by a reductionist approach that focuses on a single metabolic pathway . Particularly valuable is the use of radioactive tracers at the whole - organism , tissue and cellular levels , which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products . The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated . A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue ; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome . Overall , these studies give a good view of the structure and function of simple metabolic pathways , but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell . </P> <P> An idea of the complexity of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right : the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes . However , it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior . These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies . Using these techniques , a model of human metabolism has now been produced , which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research . These models are now used in network analysis , to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites . </P> <P> Bacterial metabolic networks are a striking example of bow - tie organization , an architecture able to input a wide range of nutrients and produce a large variety of products and complex macromolecules using a relatively few intermediate common currencies . </P> <P> A major technological application of this information is metabolic engineering . Here , organisms such as yeast , plants or bacteria are genetically modified to make them more useful in biotechnology and aid the production of drugs such as antibiotics or industrial chemicals such as 1 , 3 - propanediol and shikimic acid . These genetic modifications usually aim to reduce the amount of energy used to produce the product , increase yields and reduce the production of wastes . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Further information : History of biochemistry and History of molecular biology <P> The term metabolism is derived from the Greek \\u039c\\u03b5\\u03c4\\u03b1\\u03b2\\u03bf\\u03bb\\u03b9\\u03c3\\u03bc\\u03cc\\u03c2 -- `` Metabolismos '' for `` change '' , or `` overthrow '' . </P> Aristotle 's metabolism as an open flow model <P> Aristotle 's The Parts of Animals sets out enough details of his views on metabolism for an open flow model to be made . He believed that at each stage of the process , materials from food were transformed , with heat being released as the classical element of fire , and residual materials being excreted as urine , bile , or faeces . </P> <P> Ibn al - Nafis described metabolism in his 1260 AD work titled Al - Risalah al - Kamiliyyah fil Siera al - Nabawiyyah ( The Treatise of Kamil on the Prophet 's Biography ) which included the following phrase `` Both the body and its parts are in a continuous state of dissolution and nourishment , so they are inevitably undergoing permanent change . '' The history of the scientific study of metabolism spans several centuries and has moved from examining whole animals in early studies , to examining individual metabolic reactions in modern biochemistry . The first controlled experiments in human metabolism were published by Santorio Santorio in 1614 in his book Ars de statica medicina . He described how he weighed himself before and after eating , sleep , working , sex , fasting , drinking , and excreting . He found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called `` insensible perspiration '' . </P> Santorio Santorio in his steelyard balance , from Ars de statica medicina , first published 1614 <P> In these early studies , the mechanisms of these metabolic processes had not been identified and a vital force was thought to animate living tissue . In the 19th century , when studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast , Louis Pasteur concluded that fermentation was catalyzed by substances within the yeast cells he called `` ferments '' . He wrote that `` alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells , not with the death or putrefaction of the cells . '' This discovery , along with the publication by Friedrich W\\u00f6hler in 1828 of a paper on the chemical synthesis of urea , and is notable for being the first organic compound prepared from wholly inorganic precursors . This proved that the organic compounds and chemical reactions found in cells were no different in principle than any other part of chemistry . </P> <P> It was the discovery of enzymes at the beginning of the 20th century by Eduard Buchner that separated the study of the chemical reactions of metabolism from the biological study of cells , and marked the beginnings of biochemistry . The mass of biochemical knowledge grew rapidly throughout the early 20th century . One of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was Hans Krebs who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism . He discovered the urea cycle and later , working with Hans Kornberg , the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle . Modern biochemical research has been greatly aided by the development of new techniques such as chromatography , X-ray diffraction , NMR spectroscopy , radioisotopic labelling , electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations . These techniques have allowed the discovery and detailed analysis of the many molecules and metabolic pathways in cells . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Metabolism portal </Li> <Li> Underwater diving portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Anthropogenic metabolism </Li> <Li> Antimetabolite </Li> <Li> Basal metabolic rate </Li> <Li> Calorimetry </Li> <Li> Isothermal microcalorimetry </Li> <Li> Inborn error of metabolism </Li> <Li> Iron - sulfur world theory , a `` metabolism first '' theory of the origin of life </Li> <Li> Metabolic disorder </Li> <Li> Primary nutritional groups </Li> <Li> Respirometry </Li> <Li> Stream metabolism </Li> <Li> Sulfur metabolism </Li> <Li> Thermic effect of food </Li> <Li> Urban metabolism </Li> <Li> Water metabolism </Li> <Li> Overflow metabolism </Li> <Li> Reactome </Li> <Li> KEGG </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Friedrich C ( 1998 ) . `` Physiology and genetics of sulfur - oxidizing bacteria '' .

The song , co-written by James and Alonzo Miller , was first released on James ' album Street Songs and became one of James ' signature songs . `` Freak '' is a slang term for a very promiscuous girl , as described in the song 's lyrics , `` She 's a very kinky girl / The kind you do n't take home to mother '' . Rolling Stone magazine ranked the song # 477 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . Nine years later , MC Hammer 's 1990 hit `` U Ca n't Touch This '' sampled it . The song was nominated for the Grammy for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 1982 Grammys . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Recording </Li> <Li> 2 Chart performance <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 2.2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Beatfreakz version </Li> <Li> 4 Sampling </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Recording ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` Super Freak '' was recorded with other tracks for the Street Songs album between December 1980 - January 1981 at the Record Plant , in Sausalito , California and Motown / Hitsville U.S.A. Recording Studios , Hollywood , CA . It features background vocals from James ' Motown labelmates The Temptations -- in which the ( Bass player ) was Greg `` Big Money '' Brown , Melvin Franklin -- and Canadian singer Taborah Johnson . The tenor saxophone solo is by Stone City Band member Daniel LeMelle . James ' improvised lyrics were later toned down by Los Angeles DJ Alonso Miller , who received co-writing credit . James apparently was not particularly excited about the song , but reputedly wanted to have something on the album that `` white folks could dance to . '' </P> <H2> Chart Performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song was a big hit for James in 1981 , charting on the pop , R&B , and dance music charts in the USA . On the Billboard Hot 100 chart , the song peaked at no . 16 in the fall of 1981 and spent 10 weeks in the top 40 . Together with two other singles from Street Songs , `` Give It to Me Baby '' and `` Ghetto Life '' , it spent three weeks at no . 1 on the American dance charts earlier that year . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1981 -- 1982 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia ( Kent Music Report ) </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Flanders ) </Td> <Td> 2 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada Top Singles ( RPM ) </Td> <Td> 40 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 2 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Single Top 100 ) </Td> <Td> 3 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> New Zealand ( Recorded Music NZ ) </Td> <Td> 4 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> 16 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play </Td> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot Soul Singles </Td> <Td> 3 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Cash Box </Td> <Td> 17 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Record World </Td> <Td> 14 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <H3> Year - end charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1981 ) </Th> <Th> Position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Flanders ) </Td> <Td> 54 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 24 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Single Top 100 ) </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H2> Beatfreakz version ( edit ) </H2> <P> On 2 October 2006 , the Beatfreakz covered the song , as `` Superfreak '' , and gained a no . 7 UK hit with it . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2006 -- 2007 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratip Flanders ) </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Dance Flanders ) </Td> <Td> 8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Finland ( Suomen virallinen lista ) </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> France ( SNEP ) </Td> <Td> 56 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ireland ( IRMA ) </Td> <Td> 20 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 34 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Single Top 100 ) </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Romania ( Romanian Top 100 ) </Td> <Td> 66 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> UK Singles ( Official Charts Company ) </Td> <Td> 7 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Sampling ( edit ) </H2> <P> The riff of the song was most popularly sampled in 1990 by MC Hammer in `` U Ca n't Touch This '' . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of number - one dance singles of 1981 ( U.S. ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Super Freaky Bluegrass '' .

Designed cities were characteristic of the Minoan , Mesopotamian , Harrapan , and Egyptian civilisations of the third millennium BC ( see Urban planning in ancient Egypt ) . The first recorded description of urban planning appears in the Epic of Gilgamesh : `` Go up on to the wall of Uruk and walk around . Inspect the foundation platform and scrutinise the brickwork . Testify that its bricks are baked bricks , And that the Seven Counsellors must have laid its foundations . One square mile is city , one square mile is orchards , one square mile is claypits , as well as the open ground of Ishtar 's temple. Three square miles and the open ground comprise Uruk . Look for the copper tablet - box , Undo its bronze lock , Open the door to its secret , Lift out the lapis lazuli tablet and read . '' </P> <P> Distinct characteristics of urban planning from remains of the cities of Harappa , Lothal , Dholavira , and Mohenjo - daro in the Indus Valley Civilisation ( in modern - day northwestern India and Pakistan ) lead archeologists to interpret them as the earliest known examples of deliberately planned and managed cities . The streets of many of these early cities were paved and laid out at right angles in a grid pattern , with a hierarchy of streets from major boulevards to residential alleys . Archaeological evidence suggests that many Harrapan houses were laid out to protect from noise and to enhance residential privacy ; many also had their own water wells , probably both for sanitary and for ritual purposes . These ancient cities were unique in that they often had drainage systems , seemingly tied to a well - developed ideal of urban sanitation . Cities laid out on the grid plan could have been an outgrowth of agriculture based on rectangular fields . </P> <P> Many Central American civilisations also planned their cities , including sewage systems and running water . In Mexico , Tenochtitlan , built on an island in Lake Texcoco in the present - day the Federal District in central Mexico , served as the capital of the Aztec empire . At its height , Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities in the world , with over 200,000 inhabitants . </P> <H2> China ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Ancient Chinese urban planning and Urban planning in China <P> China has a tradition of urban planning dating back thousands of years . </P> <H2> Greco - Roman empires ( edit ) </H2> Map of Pella , showing the grid plan of the city <P> Traditionally , the Greek philosopher Hippodamus ( 5th century BC ) is regarded as the first town planner and ' inventor ' of the orthogonal urban layout . Aristotle called him `` the father of city planning '' , and until well into the 20th century , he was indeed regarded as such . This is , however , only partly justified . The Hippodamian plan that was called after him , is an orthogonal urban layout with more or less square street blocks . Archaeological finds from ancient Egypt -- among others -- demonstrate that Hippodamus can not truly have been the inventor of this layout . Aristotle 's critique and indeed ridicule of Hippodamus , which appears in Politics 2 . 8 , is perhaps the first known example of a criticism of urban planning . </P> <P> From about the late 8th century on , Greek city - states started to found colonies along the coasts of the Mediterranean , which were centred on newly created towns and cities with more or less regular orthogonal plans . Gradually , the new layouts became more regular . After the city of Miletus was destroyed by the Persians in 494 BC , it was rebuilt in a regular form that , according to tradition , was determined by the ideas of Hippodamus of Miletus . Regular orthogonal plans particularly appear to have been laid out for new colonial cities and cities that were rebuilt in a short period of time after destruction . </P> <P> Following in the tradition of Hippodamus about a century later , Alexander commissioned the architect Dinocrates to lay out his new city of Alexandria , the grandest example of idealised urban planning of the ancient Hellenistic world , where the city 's regularity was facilitated by its level site near a mouth of the Nile . </P> <P> The ancient Romans also employed regular orthogonal structures on which they molded their colonies . They probably were inspired by Greek and Hellenic examples , as well as by regularly planned cities that were built by the Etruscans in Italy . ( See Marzabotto . ) The Roman engineer Vitruvius established principles of good design whose influence is still felt today . </P> <P> The Romans used a consolidated scheme for city planning , developed for civil convenience . The basic plan consisted of a central forum with city services , surrounded by a compact , rectilinear grid of streets . A river sometimes flowed near or through the city , providing water , transport , and sewage disposal . Hundreds of towns and cities were built by the Romans throughout their empire . Many European towns , such as Turin , preserve the remains of these schemes , which show the very logical way the Romans designed their cities . They would lay out the streets at right angles , in the form of a square grid . All roads were equal in width and length , except for two , which were slightly wider than the others . The decumanus , running east -- west , and the cardo , running north -- south , intersected in the middle to form the centre of the grid . All roads were made of carefully fitted flag stones and filled in with smaller , hard - packed rocks and pebbles . Bridges were constructed where needed . Each square marked by four roads was called an insula , the Roman equivalent of a modern city block . </P> <P> Each insula was about 80 yards ( 73 m ) square . As the city developed , it could eventually be filled with buildings of various shapes and sizes and criss - crossed with back roads and alleys . </P> <P> The city may have been surrounded by a wall to protect it from invaders and to mark the city limits . Areas outside city limits were left open as farmland . At the end of each main road was a large gateway with watchtowers . A portcullis covered the opening when the city was under siege , and additional watchtowers were constructed along the city walls . An aqueduct was built outside the city walls . </P> <P> The development of Greek and Roman urbanisation is relatively well - known , as there are relatively many written sources , and there has been much attention to the subject since the Romans and Greeks are generally regarded as the main ancestors of modern Western culture . It should not be forgotten , though , that there were also other cultures with more or less urban settlements in Europe , primarily of Celtic origin . Among these , there are also cases that appear to have been newly planned , such as the Lusatian town of Biskupin in Poland . </P> <H2> Medieval Europe ( edit ) </H2> Plan of Elburg in The Netherlands , based on the cadastral plan of 1830 . Elburg was founded in 1392 by Arent toe Boecop , steward of the duke of Gelre . Arent seems to have acted as a private entrepreneur . He had bought a piece of land next to the existing town , and he obtained permission from his lord to extend and rebuild the town , and to resettle the population of the surrounding area , selling the house lots to the settlers . The highly symmetrical layout is centred on a canalised river and an intersecting street . The symmetry is disturbed , however , by the church in the eastern corner and by the pre-existing street ( the only curved one in the whole town ) on the northwest side . The corner bastions and the wide outer ditch were added in the late 16th century . <P> After the gradual disintegration and fall of the West - Roman empire in the 5th century and the devastation by the invasions of Huns , Germanic peoples , Byzantines , Moors , Magyars , and Normans in the next five centuries , little remained of urban culture in western and central Europe . In the 10th and 11th centuries , though , there appears to have been a general improvement in the political stability and economy . This made it possible for trade and craft to grow and for the monetary economy and urban culture to revive . Initially , urban culture recovered particularly in existing settlements , often in remnants of Roman towns and cities , but later on , ever more towns were created anew . Meanwhile , the population of western Europe increased rapidly and the utilised agricultural area grew with it . The agricultural areas of existing villages were extended and new villages and towns were created in uncultivated areas as cores for new reclamations . </P> <P> Urban development in the early Middle Ages , characteristically focused on a fortress , a fortified abbey , or a ( sometimes abandoned ) Roman nucleus , occurred `` like the annular rings of a tree '' , whether in an extended village or the centre of a larger city . Since the new centre was often on high , defensible ground , the city plan took on an organic character , following the irregularities of elevation contours like the shapes that result from agricultural terracing . </P> Caernarvon ( Wales ) . Plan by John Speed , 1611 . Caernarfon castle and town were re-founded by King Edward I of England in July 1283 , during his second Welsh campaign to end the Second War of Independence . <P> In the 9th to 14th centuries , many hundreds of new towns were built in Europe , and many others were enlarged with newly planned extensions . These new towns and town extensions have played a very important role in the shaping of Europe 's geographical structures as they in modern times . New towns were founded in different parts of Europe from about the 9th century on , but most of them were realised from the 12th to 14th centuries , with a peak - period at the end of the 13th . All kinds of landlords , from the highest to the lowest rank , tried to found new towns on their estates , in order to gain economical , political or military power . The settlers of the new towns generally were attracted by fiscal , economic , and juridical advantages granted by the founding lord , or were forced to move from elsewhere from his estates . Most of the new towns were to remain rather small ( as for instance the bastides of southwestern France ) , but some of them became important cities , such as Cardiff , Leeds , ' s - Hertogenbosch , Montauban , Bilbao , Malm\\u00f6 , L\\u00fcbeck , Munich , Berlin , Bern , Klagenfurt , Alessandria , Warsaw and Sarajevo . </P> <P> From the evidence of the preserved towns , it appears that the formal structure of many of these towns was willfully planned . The newly founded towns often show a marked regularity in their plan form , in the sense that the streets are often straight and laid out at right angles to one another , and that the house lots are rectangular , and originally largely of the same size . One very clear and relatively extreme example is Elburg in the Netherlands , dating from the end of the 14th century . ( see illustration ) Looking at town plans such as the one of Elburg , it clearly appears that it is impossible to maintain that the straight street and the symmetrical , orthogonal town plan were new inventions from ' the Renaissance , ' and , therefore , typical of ' modern times . ' </P> <P> The deep depression around the middle of the 14th century marked the end of the period of great urban expansion . Only in the parts of Europe where the process of urbanisation had started relatively late , as in eastern Europe , was it still to go on for one or two more centuries . It would not be until the Industrial Revolution that the same level of expansion of urban population would be reached again , although the number of newly created settlements would remain much lower than in the 12th and 13th centuries . </P> <H2> Renaissance Europe ( 1300 - 1600 ) ( edit ) </H2> <P> Florence was an early model of the new urban planning , which took on a star - shaped layout adapted from the new star fort , designed to resist cannon fire . This model was widely imitated , reflecting the enormous cultural power of Florence in this age ; `` ( t ) he Renaissance was hypnotised by one city type which for a century and a half -- from Filarete to Scamozzi -- was impressed upon utopian schemes : this is the star - shaped city '' . Radial streets extend outward from a defined centre of military , communal or spiritual power . </P> The Ideal City ( probably by Fra Carnevale , c. 1480 -- 1484 ) exemplifies Renaissance ideals of urban planning . The Roman archway and colosseum suggest the value of military victory and mass entertainment . The ideal centrally planned urban space : Sposalizio by Raphael Sanzio , 1504 <P> Only in ideal cities did a centrally planned structure stand at the heart , as in Raphael 's Sposalizio ( Illustration ) of 1504 . As built , the unique example of a rationally planned quattrocento new city centre , that of Vigevano ( 1493 -- 95 ) , resembles a closed space instead , surrounded by arcading . </P> <P> Filarete 's ideal city , building on Leon Battista Alberti 's De re aedificatoria , was named `` Sforzinda '' in compliment to his patron ; its twelve - pointed shape , circumscribable by a `` perfect '' Pythagorean figure , the circle , took no heed of its undulating terrain in Filarete 's manuscript . This process occurred in cities , but ordinarily not in the industrial suburbs characteristic of this era ( see Braudel , The Structures of Everyday Life ) , which remained disorderly and characterised by crowding and organic growth . </P> <P> Following the 1695 bombardment of Brussels by the French troops of King Louis XIV , in which a large part of the city centre was destroyed , Governor Max Emanuel proposed using the reconstruction to completely change the layout and architectural style of the city . His plan was to transform the medieval city into a city of the new baroque style , modeled on Turin , with a logical street layout , with straight avenues offering long , uninterrupted views flanked by buildings of a uniform size . This plan was opposed by residents and municipal authorities , who wanted a rapid reconstruction , did not have the resources for grandiose proposals , and resented what they considered the imposition of a new , foreign , architectural style . In the actual reconstruction , the general layout of the city was conserved , but it was not identical to that before the cataclysm . Despite the necessity of rapid reconstruction and the lack of financial means , authorities did take several measures to improve traffic flow , sanitation , and the aesthetics of the city . Many streets were made as wide as possible to improve traffic flow . </P> <H2> Enlightenment Europe and America ( edit ) </H2> During the Second French Empire , Haussmann transformed the medieval city of Paris into a modern capital , with long , straight , wide boulevards . The planning was influenced by many factors , not the least of which was the city 's history of street revolutions . Illustration of Savannah , Georgia on the Oglethorpe Plan in 1734 . <P> During this period , rulers often embarked on ambitious attempts at redesigning their capital cities as a showpiece for the grandeur of the nation . Disasters were often a major catalyst for planned reconstruction . An exception to this was in London after the Great Fire of 1666 when , despite many radical rebuilding schemes from architects such as John Evelyn and Christopher Wren , no large - scale redesigning was achieved due to the complexities of rival ownership claims . However , improvements were made in hygiene and fire safety with wider streets , stone construction and access to the river . </P> <P> The Great Fire did , however , stimulate thinking about urban design that influenced city planning in North America . The Grand Model for the Province of Carolina , developed in the aftermath of the Great Fire , established a template for colonial planning . The famous Oglethorpe Plan for Savannah ( 1733 ) was in part influenced by the Grand Model . </P> Model of the seismically protective wooden structure , the `` gaiola pombalina '' ( pombaline cage ) , developed for the reconstruction of Pombaline Lower Town <P> In contrast , after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake , King Joseph I of Portugal and his ministers immediately launched efforts to rebuild the city . The architect Manuel da Maia boldly proposed razing entire sections of the city and `` laying out new streets without restraint '' . This last option was chosen by the king and his minister . Keen to have a new and perfectly ordered city , the king commissioned the construction of big squares , rectilinear , large avenues and widened streets -- the new mottos of Lisbon . The Pombaline buildings were among the earliest seismically protected constructions in Europe . </P> <P> An even more ambitious reconstruction was carried out in Paris . In 1852 , Baron Georges - Eug\\u00e8ne Haussmann was commissioned to remodel the Medieval street plan of the city by demolishing swathes of the old quarters and laying out wide boulevards , extending outwards beyond the old city limits . Haussmann 's project encompassed all aspects of urban planning , both in the centre of Paris and in the surrounding districts , with regulations imposed on building fa\\u00e7ades , public parks , sewers and water works , city facilities , and public monuments . Beyond aesthetic and sanitary considerations , the wide thoroughfares facilitated troop movement and policing . </P> <P> A concurrent plan to extend Barcelona was based on a scientific analysis of the city and its modern requirements . It was drawn up by the Catalan engineer Ildefons Cerd\\u00e0 to fill the space beyond the city walls after they were demolished from 1854 . He is credited with inventing the term ' urbanisation ' and his approach was codified in his General Theory of Urbanisation ( 1867 ) . Cerd\\u00e0 's Eixample ( Catalan for ' extension ' ) consisted of 550 regular blocks with chamfered corners to facilitate the movement of trams , crossed by three wider avenues . His objectives were to improve the health of the inhabitants , towards which the blocks were built around central gardens and orientated NW - SE to maximise the sunlight they received , and assist social integration . </P> <H2> Modern urban planning ( edit ) </H2> <P> Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century . The industrialised cities of the 19th century had grown at a tremendous rate , with the pace and style of building largely dictated by private business concerns . The evils of urban life for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter for public concern . The laissez - faire style of government management of the economy , in fashion for most of the Victorian era , was starting to give way to a New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged . Around 1900 , theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age , by providing citizens , especially factory workers , with healthier environments . </P> <P> Modern zoning , which enabled planners to legally demarcate sections of cities for different functions , originated in Prussia , and spread to Britain , the USA , and Scandinavia . Public health was cited as a rationale for keeping cities organized . </P> <H3> Garden city movement ( edit ) </H3> Ebenezer Howard 's influential 1902 diagram , illustrating urban growth through garden city `` off - shoots '' <P> The first major urban planning theorist was Sir Ebenezer Howard , who initiated the garden city movement in 1898 . This was inspired by earlier planned communities built by industrial philanthropists in the countryside , such as Cadburys ' Bournville , Lever 's Port Sunlight and George Pullman 's eponymous Pullman in Chicago . All these settlements decentralised the working environment from the centre of the cities , and provided a healthy living space for the factory workers . Howard generalised this achievement into a planned movement for the country as a whole . He was also influenced by the work of economist Alfred Marshall who argued in 1884 that industry needed a supply of labour that could in theory be supplied anywhere , and that companies have an incentive to improve workers living standards as the company bears much of the cost inflicted by the unhealthy urban conditions in the big cities . </P> <P> Howard 's ideas , although utopian , were also highly practical and were adopted around the world in the ensuing decades . His garden cities were intended to be planned , self - contained communities surrounded by parks , containing proportionate and separate areas of residences , industry , and agriculture . Inspired by the Utopian novel Looking Backward and Henry George 's work Progress and Poverty , Howard published his book Garden Cities of To - morrow in 1898 , commonly regarded as the most important book in the history of urban planning . His idealised garden city would house 32,000 people on a site of 6,000 acres ( 2,428 ha ) , planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces , public parks and six radial boulevards , 120 ft ( 37 m ) wide , extending from the centre . The garden city would be self - sufficient and when it reached full population , another garden city would be developed nearby . Howard envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000 people , linked by road and rail . </P> <P> He founded First Garden City , Ltd. in 1899 to create the first garden city at Letchworth , Hertfordshire . Donors to the project collected interest on their investment if the garden city generated profits through rents or , as Fishman calls the process , ' philanthropic land speculation ' . Howard tried to include working class cooperative organisations , which included over two million members , but could not win their financial support . In 1904 , Raymond Unwin , a noted architect and town planner , along with his partner Richard Barry Parker , won the competition run by the First Garden City , Limited to plan Letchworth , an area 34 miles outside London . Unwin and Parker planned the town in the centre of the Letchworth estate with Howard 's large agricultural greenbelt surrounding the town , and they shared Howard 's notion that the working class deserved better and more affordable housing . However , the architects ignored Howard 's symmetric design , instead replacing it with a more ' organic ' design . </P> <P> Welwyn Garden City , also in Hertfordshire was also built on Howard 's principles . His successor as chairman of the Garden City Association was Sir Frederic Osborn , who extended the movement to regional planning . </P> <P> The principles of the garden city were soon applied to the planning of city suburbs . The first such project was the Hampstead Garden Suburb founded by Henrietta Barnett and planned by Parker and Unwin . The scheme 's utopian ideals were that it should be open to all classes of people with free access to woods and gardens and that the housing should be of low density with wide , tree - lined roads . </P> <P> In North America , the Garden City movement was also popular , and evolved into the `` Neighbourhood Unit '' form of development . In the early 1900s , as cars were introduced to city streets for the first time , residents became increasingly concerned with the number of pedestrians being injured by car traffic . The response , seen first in Radburn , New Jersey , was the Neighbourhood Unit - style development , which oriented houses toward a common public path instead of the street . The neighbourhood is distinctively organised around a school , with the intention of providing children a safe way to walk to school . </P> <H3> Urban planning profession ( edit ) </H3> <P> Urban planning became professionalised at this period , with input from utopian visionaries as well as from the practical minded infrastructure engineers and local councillors combining to produce new design templates for political consideration . The Town and Country Planning Association was founded in 1899 and the first academic course on urban planning was offered by the University of Liverpool in 1909 . </P> <P> The first official consideration of these new trends was embodied in the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909 that compelled local authorities to introduce coherent systems of town planning across the country using the new principles of the ' garden city ' , and to ensure that all housing construction conformed to specific building standards . </P> <P> Following this Act , surveyors , civil engineers , architects , lawyers and others began working together within local government in the UK to draw up schemes for the development of land and the idea of town planning as a new and distinctive area of expertise began to be formed . In 1910 , Thomas Adams was appointed as the first Town Planning Inspector at the Local Government Board , and began meeting with practitioners . The Town Planning Institute was established in 1914 with a mandate to advance the study of town - planning and civic design . The first university course in America was established at Harvard University in 1924 . </P> <P> The Tudor Walters Committee that recommended the building of housing estates after World War One incorporated the ideas of Howard 's disciple Raymond Unwin , who demonstrated that homes could be built rapidly and economically whilst maintaining satisfactory standards for gardens , family privacy and internal spaces . Unwin diverged from Howard by proposing that the new developments should be peripheral ' satellites ' rather than fully - fledged garden cities . </P> <H3> Modernism ( edit ) </H3> Partiz\\u00e1nske in Slovakia -- an example of a typical planned industrial city founded in 1938 together with a shoemaking factory in which practically all adult inhabitants of the city were employed . A 1939 model envisions Berlin transformed into the Welthauptstadt Germania ( World Capital Germania ) . <P> In the 1920s , the ideas of modernism began to surface in urban planning . The influential modernist architect Le Corbusier presented his scheme for a `` Contemporary City '' for three million inhabitants ( Ville Contemporaine ) in 1922 . The centrepiece of this plan was the group of sixty - story cruciform skyscrapers , steel - framed office buildings encased in huge curtain walls of glass . These skyscrapers were set within large , rectangular , park - like green spaces . At the centre was a huge transportation hub that on different levels included depots for buses and trains , as well as highway intersections , and at the top , an airport . Le Corbusier had the fanciful notion that commercial airliners would land between the huge skyscrapers . He segregated pedestrian circulation paths from the roadways and glorified the automobile as a means of transportation . As one moved out from the central skyscrapers , smaller low - story , zig - zag apartment blocks ( set far back from the street amid green space ) housed the inhabitants . Le Corbusier hoped that politically minded industrialists in France would lead the way with their efficient Taylorist and Fordist strategies adopted from American industrial models to re-organise society . </P> <P> In 1925 , he exhibited his `` Plan Voisin '' , in which he proposed to bulldoze most of central Paris north of the Seine and replace it with his sixty - story cruciform towers from the Contemporary City , placed within an orthogonal street grid and park - like green space . In the 1930s , Le Corbusier expanded and reformulated his ideas on urbanism , eventually publishing them in La Ville radieuse ( The Radiant City ) in 1935 . Perhaps the most significant difference between the Contemporary City and the Radiant City is that the latter abandoned the class - based stratification of the former ; housing was now assigned according to family size , not economic position . Le Corbusier 's theories were sporadically adopted by the builders of public housing in Europe and the United States . </P> <P> Many of his disciples became notable in their own right , including painter - architect Nadir Afonso , who absorbed Le Corbusier 's ideas into his own aesthetics theory . L\\u00facio Costa 's city plan of Bras\\u00edlia and the industrial city of Zl\\u00edn planned by Franti\\u0161ek Lydie Gahura in the Czech Republic are notable plans based on his ideas , while the architect himself produced the plan for Chandigarh in India . Le Corbusier 's thinking also had been profoundly effected by the philosophy of Futurism and Constructivism in Russia at the turn of the 20th century . </P> <P> Another important theorist was Sir Patrick Geddes who understood the importance of taking the regional environment into account and the relationship between social issues and town planning , and foresaw the emergence of huge urban conurbations . In 1927 , he was commissioned to plan the city of Tel Aviv , then in Mandatory Palestine . It consisted of about 40 blocks , sized around 150 metres squared . The block contained an inner small public garden , disposed into a windmill configuration of inner access roads , making it awkward for car traffic . The big blocks form a gently undulating street pattern , north - south commercial , east - west arranged to catch the sea breeze . This was a simple and efficient manner to modernise the historical fixed grid patterns . A series of shaded boulevards short cuts the system , with some public squares , accessing the sea front . The plan of the new town became a success . </P> <P> Urban planning in communist countries has often modeled itself on Western modernism , using the authority of the state to implement efficient urban designs produced in administrative centers . ( In Russia this process was nominally decentralized after the end of the USSR , but Moscow remains the source of much of the country 's urban planning expertise . ) Germany under national socialism also undertook grandiose schemes for urban redesign . </P> <H3> New towns ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ebenezer Howard 's urban planning concepts were only adopted on a large scale after World War II . The damage brought on by the war provoked significant public interest in what post-war Britain would be like , which was encouraged by the government , who facilitated talk about a ' Better Britain ' to boost morale . Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London , which , for the first time , addressed the issue of de-centralisation . Firstly , the County of London Plan 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density . Moreover , the Greater London Plan of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs , existing rural towns , and new towns . </P> <P> The New Towns Act 1946 resulted in many New Towns being constructed in Britain over the following decades . </P> <P> New towns were built in the United States from the 1960s -- examples include Reston , Virginia ; Columbia , Maryland ; Jonathan , Minnesota and Riverside Plaza . This construction effort was combined with extensive federal government grants for slum clearance , improved and increased housing and road construction and comprehensive urban renewal projects . Other European countries such as France , Germany , Italy and Sweden also had some successes with new towns , especially as part of post-war reconstruction efforts . </P> <H2> Contemporary ( edit ) </H2> <P> Urban planning has grown in prominence with rising urbanization . </P> <H3> Reaction against modernism ( edit ) </H3> <P> By the late 1960s and early 1970s , many planners felt that modernism 's clean lines and lack of human scale sapped vitality from the community , blaming them for high crime rates and social problems . </P> <P> Modernist planning fell into decline in the 1970s when the construction of cheap , uniform tower blocks ended in most countries , such as Britain and France . Since then many have been demolished and replaced by other housing types . Rather than attempting to eliminate all disorder , planning now concentrates on individualism and diversity in society and the economy ; this is the post-modernist era . </P> <P> Minimally planned cities still exist . Houston is a large city ( with a metropolitan population of 5.5 million ) in a developed country without a comprehensive zoning ordinance . Houston does , however , restrict development densities and mandate parking , even though specific land uses are not regulated . Also , private - sector developers in Houston use subdivision covenants and deed restrictions to effect land - use restrictions resembling zoning laws . Houston voters have rejected comprehensive zoning ordinances three times since 1948 . </P> <H3> Behaviorism ( edit ) </H3> <P> Behaviorist psychology influenced urban planning especially in the 1960s and after , manifesting in such theories as defensible space and crime prevention through environmental design . </P> <H3> New urbanism ( edit ) </H3> Jakriborg in Sweden , started in the late 1990s as a new urbanist eco-friendly new town near Malm\\u00f6 <P> Various current movements in urban design seek to create sustainable urban environments with long - lasting structures , buildings and a great liveability for its inhabitants . The most clearly defined form of walkable urbanism is known as the Charter of New Urbanism . It is an approach for successfully reducing environmental impacts by altering the built environment to create and preserve smart cities that support sustainable transport . Residents in compact urban neighbourhoods drive fewer miles and have significantly lower environmental impacts across a range of measures compared with those living in sprawling suburbs . The concept of Circular flow land use management has also been introduced in Europe to promote sustainable land use patterns that strive for compact cities and a reduction of greenfield land taken by urban sprawl . </P> <P> In sustainable construction , the recent movement of New Classical Architecture promotes a sustainable approach towards urban construction that appreciates and develops smart growth , walkability , architectural tradition , and classical design . This is in contrast to modernist and short - lived globally uniform architecture , as well as opposing solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl . Both trends started in the 1980s . </P> <P> Critics of New Urbanism have argued that its environmental aspect is too focused on transport and excessive individual mobility . The real problem with the unsustainable nature of modern cities is not just about cars and too much driving - it is about the entire urban metabolism of the city ( of which auto - mobility is less than half of the overall ecological footprint and accounts for about half of the GHG emissions / carbon footprint ) . They have also argued that land - use planning can do little to achieve sustainability without regulating the design and associated technology of the actual development within a zoned area . Distances and density are relatively unimportant ; it is the total metabolism of the development that determines the environmental impact . Also , the emphasis needs to shift from sustainability to resilience , and the spatial scope from the city to the whole urban region A further criticism is that the New Urbanist project of compacting urban form is a difficult and slow process . In the new global situation , with the horizontal , low - density growth irreversibly dominant , and climate change already happening , it would be wiser to focus efforts on the resilience of whole city - regions , retrofitting the existing sprawl for sustainability and self - sufficiency , and investing heavily in ' green infrastructure ' . </P> <H3> Sustainable development and sustainability ( edit ) </H3> <P> Sustainable development has emerged in recent decades as guiding themes for urban planning . This term was defined and advocated in 1987 report Our Common Future , published by the World Commission on Environment and Development . </P> Robert Hoddle 's survey of Melbourne in 1837 . The layout of the city is referred to as the `` Hoddle Grid '' . <P> Some planners argue that modern lifestyles use too many natural resources , polluting or destroying ecosystems , increasing social inequality , creating urban heat islands , and causing climate change . Many urban planners , therefore , advocate sustainable cities . </P> <P> However , sustainable development is a recent , controversial concept . Wheeler , in his 2004 book , defines sustainable urban development as `` development that improves the long - term social and ecological health of cities and towns . '' He sketches a ' sustainable ' city 's features : compact , efficient land use ; less automobile use , yet better access ; efficient resource use ; less pollution and waste ; the restoration of natural systems ; good housing and living environments ; a healthy social ecology ; a sustainable economy ; community participation and involvement ; and preservation of local culture and wisdom . Urban planners are now promoting a sustainable city model , which consists of cities that are designed with consideration of environmental impacts , such as minimising the uses of energy , water , and the outputs of waste and pollution . </P> <P> Because of political and governance structures in most jurisdictions , sustainable planning measures must be widely supported before they can affect institutions and regions . Actual implementation is often a complex compromise . </P> <P> Nature in cities Often an integral party of sustainable cities is the Incorporation of nature within a city . </P> <P> Car free sustainability in city planning can include large pedestrian zones or be a totally Car free . </P> <H3> Collaborative planning in the United States ( edit ) </H3> <P> Collaborative planning arose in the US in response to the inadequacy of traditional public participation techniques to provide real opportunities for the public to make decisions affecting their communities . Collaborative planning is a method designed to empower stakeholders by elevating them to the level of decision - makers through direct engagement and dialogue between stakeholders and public agencies , to solicit ideas , active involvement , and participation in the community planning process . Active public involvement can help planners achieve better outcomes by making them aware of the public 's needs and preferences and by using local knowledge to inform projects . When properly administered , collaboration can result in more meaningful participation and better , more creative outcomes to persistent problems than can traditional participation methods . It enables planners to make decisions that reflect community needs and values , it fosters faith in the wisdom and utility of the resulting project , and the community is given a personal stake in its success . </P> <P> Experiences in Portland and Seattle have demonstrated that successful collaborative planning depends on a number of interrelated factors : the process must be truly inclusive , with all stakeholders and affected groups invited to the table ; the community must have final decision - making authority ; full government commitment ( of both financial and intellectual resources ) must be manifest ; participants should be given clear objectives by planning staff , who facilitate the process by providing guidance , consultancy , expert opinions , and research ; and facilitators should be trained in conflict resolution and community organisation . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Notes ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Dalley 1989 , p. 120 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Davreu , Robert ( 1978 ) . `` Cities of Mystery : The Lost Empire of the Indus Valley '' .

Ambler Reality Company , zoning was characterized as promoting health : ' the exclusion of buildings devoted to business , trade , etc. , from residential districts , bears a rational relation to the health and safety of the community ... by excluding from residential areas the confusion and danger of fire , contagion and disorder , which in greater or less degree attach to the location of stores , shops , and factories ' ( 272 U.S. 365 , 392 ) . Yet , there was little to no epidemiologic evidence at the time suggesting that health improvements would come about by physically separating land uses , and some have suggested that zoning tended to concentrate health hazards and perpetuate disadvantages in poor urban communities ( Maantay 2001 ) '' . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Peter Hall , Mark Tewdwr - Jones ( 2010 ) .

      "    \"text\": \"T'nalak - Wikipedia <H1> T'nalak </H1> <P> T'nalak is the traditional tapestry making of the T'bolis from South Cotabato in the Philippines </P> <H2> Introduction ( edit ) </H2> <P> T'nalak is a traditional cloth found in Mindanao island made by a group of people in Lake Sebu , South Cotabato called T'bolis , Tboli people . This traditional cloth is hand - woven made of Abaca fibers which traditionally has three primary colors , red , black and the original color of the Abaca leaves . The colorant of the materials are naturally dyed boiled in with bark , roots and leaves of plants . It is an heritage and believed that the intricate and creative patterns of the Tinalak was seen on their dreams and made it on to work . They ca n't create a design of the Tinalak if they have n't dreamed of it . They are sometimes called the `` Dream Weavers '' . </P> <P> The T'nalak fabric holds a special and prominent place in ( T'boli ) culture . It is ever present in significant turning points in a ( Tboli ) life , such as birth , marriage , and death . It is the medium which sanctifies these rites , enveloping them in the length of its fabric like a benediction . It has also often been referred to as `` woven dreams '' . It is exactly that , and more . In a culture which did n't have a form of writing , the T'nalak served as both Literature and Art . The ( T'bolis ) expressed everything they are in the T'nalak : their dreams , beliefs , myths and even their religion . Making use of the various geometrical patterns and the trademark red , black and white colors , the ( T'bolis ) weave the natural and the supernatural in the abaca strands of the T'nalak . Furthermore , the weaving process integrates the personal , the social and the cultural . After a weaver reaches a certain degree of expertise , she becomes a `` master weaver '' -- someone who can interpret and take inspiration from dreams , hence the term `` dreamweavers '' . By all accounts , this seems to be an intense personal experience for the weaver , and the moment she succeeds in doing this is the moment she becomes an artist . And then it is also social because the T'nalak binds together all that the ( T'boli ) people believe in . The skill of the weaver gathers in the T'nalak all the elements that make the ( T'boli ) social life . Finally , it is cultural in that it is the means through which other tribes identify the ( T'bolis ) since the T'nalak is uniquely and distinctly ( T'boli ) . from Gida Ofong ( T'boli tribeswoman and dreamweaver ) </P> <P> Tinalak are also their prized possession at marriage , even the covering for childbirth for ensuring safe delivery and for trading . Whenever they sell their work , they put a brass ring around it as for the spirits to allow them or to please . They 're not even allowed to cut the Tinalak ' cause of what they believe it would deliver them sickness . </P> <H2> External links ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> T'nalak Dream Weaving </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This clothing - related article is a stub .

It was the first hit single for producer Quincy Jones . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Theme </Li> <Li> 2 Background </Li> <Li> 3 Charts <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 3.2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin version <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Charts <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 4.1. 2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Other cover versions </Li> <Li> 6 The sequel : `` Judy 's Turn to Cry '' </Li> <Li> 7 Charts <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 7.2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Notes </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Theme ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song lyrically portrays the discomfiture of a teenage girl at her birthday party when her boyfriend Johnny disappears , only to surface in the company of Judy , another girl , who is `` wearing his ring , '' to indicate she 's replaced the birthday girl as his love interest . </P> <P> The song 's chorus , `` It 's my party , and I 'll cry if I want to ... You would cry too if it happened to you ! '' became a part of American pop cultural language as a phrase used to describe being utterly humiliated and miserable during an event that is supposed to be a happy occasion . </P> <P> `` It 's My Party '' is in the key of A major . The song 's effectiveness is enhanced by several musical touches producer Quincy Jones incorporated , including Latin - sounding rhythms , double tracked vocals and effective horn parts . Allmusic critic Jason Ankeny wrote of the song , `` ' It 's My Party ' remains one of the most vivid evocations of adolescent heartbreak ever waxed -- Quincy Jones produced the record , although you 'd swear it was Aaron Spelling instead . '' </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` It 's My Party '' was credited to John Gluck , Wally Gold and Herb Weiner , staff writers at the Aaron Schroeder Music firm in 1962 . The lyrics were actually written by Seymour Gottlieb , a freelance songwriter . He gave the lyrics to Herb Weiner , with whom he partnered in writing songs , to peddle . It was based on actual events relating to Gottlieb 's daughter Judy 's ' Sweet 16 ' party , before which she cried over the prospect of her grandparents being invited . The demo for the song was cut by Barbara Jean English , a girl group veteran ( the Clickettes , the Fashions ) , who was then working as a receptionist at the firm . She also worked with Jimmy Radcliffe , serving as the firm 's in - house demo singer . Radcliffe produced the demo , and , according to English , `` tried to persuade Musicor ( the label owned by Aaron Schroeder ) to release it as a record , or to take me into a master studio and redo it , but they were n't interested . '' </P> <P> The first recording of the song was in 1962 by The Chiffons for their One Fine Day album . It was also recorded by Helen Shapiro for her Helen in Nashville album in February 1963 with Shapiro 's regular producer , Norrie Paramor , and also Al Kasha . Shapiro would recall : `` Right from the first time we heard the song on the rough demo back in London , we thought we were going to sock them between the eyes with that one '' ; however , Shapiro 's version was not one of the cuts chosen as an advance single from the album and by the time of the album 's release that October the `` It 's My Party '' track was perceived as a cover of Lesley Gore 's hit . </P> <P> Lesley Gore recalls that `` It 's My Party '' was among some two hundred demos producer Quincy Jones brought to review with her in the den of her family home in February 1963 . On hearing `` It 's My Party , '' Gore told Jones : `` That 's not half bad . I like it . Good melody . Let 's put it on the maybe pile . '' The song proved to be the only demo Gore and Jones found agreeable . With Jones producing and Claus Ogerman handling arranging and conducting duties , Gore recorded ' It 's My Party ' at Bell Sound Studios in Manhattan on March 30 , 1963 . </P> <P> In March 1963 Phil Spector heard the demo of `` It 's My Party '' while visiting Aaron Schroeder 's office . Wally Gold would recall : `` He ( Spector ) said , ' Great , I love it . I 'm gon na do it with the Crystals . ' We ( the song 's writers ) were really excited , because that would ensure that the record was # 1 ! '' Schroeder apparently only learned of the Lesley Gore recording of `` It 's My Party '' when Quincy Jones invited him to hear the completed track , which Schroeder found formulaic ; believing that Spector would be able to cut a much stronger version of the song with the Crystals and not wanting to lose Spector 's good will , Schroeder attempted to convince Jones to suppress the track . Schroeder did not mention Spector 's version to Jones but Jones and Spector both happened to attend a concert with Charles Aznavour at Carnegie Hall on the evening of March 30 , 1963 and when they met outside it came up in conversation that Spector had recorded a version of `` It 's My Party '' with the Crystals . Jones skipped the concert instead spending that night -- a Saturday -- at Bell Sound Studios making a test pressing of the track comprising one hundred copies . </P> <P> Over the next two days Jones mailed these out to radio programmers in key markets across the US . Gore heard her record played on the radio for the first time that Friday ; the official release of `` It 's My Party '' came later in the month , with the disc ascending to number one nationally in four weeks . Jones was abroad at the time of `` It 's My Party '' 's release . On his return he expressed dismay when Aaron Schroeder advised him that the rush release of `` It 's My Party '' had precluded coining a more pleasant name for the singer than `` Lesley Gore , '' to which Schroeder replied : `` Did n't anybody tell you ? ... Quince , the record 's number one . Do you really give a damn what her last name is ? '' </P> <P> In 1980 , WCBN - FM , the University of Michigan freeform student radio station , played `` It 's My Party '' for 18 hours straight the day after Ronald Reagan was elected . </P> <H2> Charts ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1963 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Australia ( Kent Music Report ) </Th> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> New Zealand ( Listener ) </Th> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> UK Singles ( Official Charts Company ) </Th> <Td> 9 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Billboard Hot 100 </Th> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US R&B ( Billboard ) </Th> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Cash Box Top 100 </Th> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <H3> Year - end charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1963 ) </Th> <Th> Position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Billboard Hot 100 </Th> <Td> 29 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Cash Box </Th> <Td> 30 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin version ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> `` It 's My Party '' </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Single by Dave Stewart with Barbara Gaskin </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> B - side </Th> <Td> `` Waiting in the Wings '' </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Released </Th> <Td> August 1981 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Format </Th> <Td> 7 '' vinyl </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Recorded </Th> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genre </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Synthpop </Li> <Li> new wave </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Length </Th> <Td> 3 : 47 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Label </Th> <Td> Stiff </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Songwriter ( s ) </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Wally Gold </Li> <Li> John Gluck Jr . </Li> <Li> Herb Weiner </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Producer ( s ) </Th> <Td> Dave Stewart </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Dave Stewart with Barbara Gaskin singles chronology </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` It 's My Party '' ( 1981 ) </Td> <Td> `` Johnny Rocco '' ( 1982 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In 1981 , a remake by British artists Dave Stewart and Barbara Gaskin was a UK number - one hit single for four weeks , becoming the first version of the song to reach number one in the UK .

In this song , the teenage girl narrator gets her revenge on Judy . In the lyrics the narrator explicitly finds `` foolish '' how much she cried when she saw Johnny and Judy together , and seems determined to start anew . But after she kisses another boy at another party , Johnny gets jealous , punches the other boy and returns to her . Following just two months on the heels of `` It 's My Party , '' the sequel reached number five on the charts . </P> <H2> Charts ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1963 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Billboard Hot 100 </Th> <Td> 5 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <H3> Year - end charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1963 ) </Th> <Th> Position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Billboard Hot 100 </Th> <Td> 83 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ As with `` He 's a Rebel '' , the Crystals ' hit for which it was intended as the follow - up , `` It 's My Party '' was actually recorded not by the Crystals but the Blossoms , who cut the track at Gold Star Studios .

It was nominated for 2009 Grammy Awards in the categories Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance . </P> <P> `` Love Song '' managed to spend 19 weeks in the top ten and an overall 41 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 , peaking at number four there . Similarly , it peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts . It also reached number one on the Canadian Hot 100 , while topping the US Mainstream Top 40 airplay chart . It also spent many weeks atop the Hot Adult Pop Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts , ending up number one at the year - end tally of both charts . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Inspiration </Li> <Li> 2 Music video </Li> <Li> 3 Chart performance </Li> <Li> 4 Charts <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 4.2 Year - end charts </Li> <Li> 4.3 Decade - end charts </Li> <Li> 4.4 All - time charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Certifications </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Inspiration ( edit ) </H2> <P> Speaking of the song 's origin , Bareilles said of her label , `` They had encouraged me to keep writing , and I just was n't having any luck ... I started to get really insecure about it , and then I got really pissed off at myself for caring what anybody thought ... I went to a rehearsal space one day . I sat down and wrote something for me . And ' Love Song ' basically wrote itself . It 's totally honest , and I 'm very lucky the label liked it as well . '' </P> <P> Later in 2011 , she explained : `` It was actually written for my record label . I had been turning in new music . I was getting the red light . I could n't go into the studio yet because they were waiting for something . But I would n't ... nobody said what they were waiting for . So I kept turning in new songs , thinking like , ' Is this what you want ? Is this what you want ? ' And it was always a big thumbs down , and I ended up writing ' Love Song ' out of frustration . '' In 2014 , she stated it was `` very tongue - in - cheek '' and `` nasty in a passive - aggressive way , '' confirming it was a response to the record label pressuring her to make safe , `` radio friendly '' songs . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> Directed by Josh Forbes , the music video features a miniature Bareilles playing the piano inside a coin - operated jukebox that plays love songs . A steady stream of men and women enter the booth and insert coins to observing her through a pinhole as she plays the same song day after day . The lyrics express her growing frustration as she declares that she is `` not gon na write you a love song today , '' whereupon Bareilles grabs the next coin that rolls inside , and uses it to jam the gears . The next morning , the owner of the booth ( who was seen at the beginning of the video ) enters ; he notices that the jukebox has gone dark , and appears amazed when he discovers Bareilles inside the jukebox . He retrieves the jammed coin from the gears and hands it to Bareilles . </P> <P> The music video features the album version of the song . The video also features British actor Adam Campbell as the owner of the booth . </P> <H2> Chart Performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> Featured initially as the free iTunes song of the week on June 16 , 2007 , the song was a sleeper - hit , debuting a few months later at number 100 on the US Billboard Hot 100 . After her appearance in a Rhapsody TV commercial , in which she performs `` Love Song '' , it rocketed from number 72 to number 16 on the Hot 100 and from number 32 to number 5 on the Hot Digital Songs chart . In the first week of 2008 , the song cracked the top ten on the Hot 100 , jumping to number 9 , where it stayed for four non-consecutive weeks before reaching a peak of number 4 . In spite of not reaching the top three , `` Love Song '' managed to spend 19 weeks in the top ten , in contrast with other songs that reached higher peak but did not maintain such longevity . The single was certified 4x Platinum by the RIAA for over 4 million in sales . As of April 2014 , the single had sold 3,717,000 digital copies in the United States . </P> <P> The song debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 30 and later peaked at number 4 . The song debuted at number 100 on the Canadian Hot 100 the week of January 31 , 2008 , and reached number one on the chart the week of March 29 , 2008 . In Australia , `` Love Song '' peaked at number 4 in its ninth week on the country 's chart . In New Zealand it reached number 7 on the Top 40 singles chart and held the number 1 position on the Radio Airplay chart for six weeks . It was the most played song of 2008 on New Zealand radio . In Spain , the song debuted at number 33 and has so far peaked at number 13 . </P> <P> The song is listed at number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 year - end chart of 2008 . It also topped both the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks charts in 2008 . </P> <H2> Charts ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2007 -- 08 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia ( ARIA ) </Td> <Td> 4 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Austria ( \\u00d63 Austria Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Flanders ) </Td> <Td> 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Belgium ( Ultratop 50 Wallonia ) </Td> <Td> 12 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada ( Canadian Hot 100 ) </Td> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Denmark ( Tracklisten ) </Td> <Td> 9 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Finland Download ( Latauslista ) </Td> <Td> 27 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Germany ( Official German Charts ) </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Ireland ( IRMA ) </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Italy ( FIMI ) </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> New Zealand ( Recorded Music NZ ) </Td> <Td> 7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sweden ( Sverigetopplistan ) </Td> <Td> 17 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Switzerland ( Schweizer Hitparade ) </Td> <Td> 16 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> UK Singles ( Official Charts Company ) </Td> <Td> 4 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> 4 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Adult Alternative Songs ( Billboard ) </Td> <Td> 3 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Adult Contemporary ( Billboard ) </Td> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Adult Top 40 ( Billboard ) </Td> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Mainstream Top 40 ( Billboard ) </Td> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <H3> Year - end charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2008 ) </Th> <Th> Position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia ( ARIA ) </Td> <Td> 37 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada ( Canadian Hot 100 ) </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 14 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> New Zealand ( RIANZ ) </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> UK Singles ( Official Charts Company ) </Td> <Td> 55 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> 7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Pop Songs ( Billboard ) </Td> <Td> 12 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Adult Contemporary ( Billboard ) </Td> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Adult Pop Songs ( Billboard ) </Td> <Td> 1 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2009 ) </Th> <Th> Position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hungary ( R\\u00e1di\\u00f3s Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 149 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Decade - end charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2000 - 2009 ) </Th> <Th> Position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Billboard Hot 100 </Th> <Td> 77 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> All - time charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1958 -- 2018 ) </Th> <Th> Position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Billboard Hot 100 </Th> <Td> 575 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Certifications ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Region </Th> <Th> Certification </Th> <Th> Certified units / Sales </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Australia ( ARIA ) </Th> <Td> Platinum </Td> <Td> 70,000 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Canada ( Music Canada ) </Th> <Td> Gold </Td> <Td> 40,000 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Denmark ( IFPI Denmark ) </Th> <Td> Gold </Td> <Td> 7,500 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> United Kingdom ( BPI ) </Th> <Td> Gold </Td> <Td> 400,000 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> United States ( RIAA ) </Th> <Td> 4 \\u00d7 Platinum </Td> <Td> 4,000,000 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\\\"3\\\"> <P> shipments figures based on certification alone sales + streaming figures based on certification alone </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of Hot 100 number - one singles of 2008 ( Canada ) </Li> <Li> List of Mainstream Top 40 number - one hits of 2008 ( U.S. ) </Li> <Li> List of number - one adult contemporary singles of 2008 ( U.S. ) </Li> <Li> List of Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks number - one singles of 2008 </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Sara Bareilles Chart History ( Hot 100 ) '' .

As a form of electromagnetic radiation , like light waves , radio waves are affected by the phenomena of reflection , refraction , diffraction , absorption , polarization , and scattering . Understanding the effects of varying conditions on radio propagation has many practical applications , from choosing frequencies for international shortwave broadcasters , to designing reliable mobile telephone systems , to radio navigation , to operation of radar systems . </P> <P> Several different types of propagation are used in practical radio transmission systems . Line - of - sight propagation means radio waves which travel in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna . Line of sight transmission is used to medium range radio transmission such as cell phones , cordless phones , walkie - talkies , wireless networks , FM radio and television broadcasting and radar , and satellite communication , such as satellite television . Line - of - sight transmission on the surface of the Earth is limited to the distance to the visual horizon , which depends on the height of transmitting and receiving antennas . It is the only propagation method possible at microwave frequencies and above . At microwave frequencies , moisture in the atmosphere ( rain fade ) can degrade transmission . </P> <P> At lower frequencies in the MF , LF , and VLF bands , due to diffraction radio waves can bend over obstacles like hills , and travel beyond the horizon as surface waves which follow the contour of the Earth . These are called ground waves . AM broadcasting stations use ground waves to cover their listening areas . As the frequency gets lower , the attenuation with distance decreases , so very low frequency ( VLF ) and extremely low frequency ( ELF ) ground waves can be used to communicate worldwide . VLF and ELF waves can penetrate significant distances through water and earth , and these frequencies are used for mine communication and military communication with submerged submarines . </P> <P> At medium wave and shortwave frequencies ( MF and HF bands ) radio waves can refract from a layer of charged particles ( ions ) high in the atmosphere , called the ionosphere . This means that radio waves transmitted at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon , at great distances , even transcontinental distances . This is called skywave propagation . It is used by amateur radio operators to talk to other countries , and shortwave broadcasting stations that broadcast internationally . Skywave communication is variable , dependent on conditions in the upper atmosphere ; it is most reliable at night and in the winter . Due to its unreliability , since the advent of communication satellites in the 1960s , many long range communication needs that previously used skywaves now use satellites . </P> <P> In addition , there are several less common radio propagation mechanisms , such as tropospheric scattering ( troposcatter ) and near vertical incidence skywave ( NVIS ) which are used in specialized communication systems . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Free space propagation </Li> <Li> 2 Modes <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Direct modes ( line - of - sight ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Surface modes ( groundwave ) </Li> <Li> 2.3 Ionospheric modes ( skywave ) <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Meteor scattering </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Auroral backscatter </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 Sporadic - E propagation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.4 Tropospheric modes <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 Tropospheric ducting </Li> <Li> 2.4. 2 Tropospheric scattering ( troposcatter ) </Li> <Li> 2.4. 3 Rain scattering </Li> <Li> 2.4. 4 Airplane scattering </Li> <Li> 2.4. 5 Lightning scattering </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.5 Other effects <Ul> <Li> 2.5. 1 Diffraction </Li> <Li> 2.5. 2 Absorption </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Measuring HF propagation </Li> <Li> 4 Practical effects </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 Further reading </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Free space propagation ( edit ) </H2> <P> In free space , all electromagnetic waves ( radio , light , X-rays , etc . ) obey the inverse - square law which states that the power density \\u03c1 ( \\\\ displaystyle \\\\ rho \\\\ , ) of an electromagnetic wave is proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance r ( \\\\ displaystyle r \\\\ , ) from a point source or : </P> <Dl> <Dd> \\u03c1 \\u221d 1 r 2 . ( \\\\ displaystyle \\\\ rho \\\\ propto ( \\\\ frac ( 1 ) ( r ^ ( 2 ) ) ) . ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> At typical communication distances from a transmitter , the transmitting antenna usually can be approximated by a point source . Doubling the distance of a receiver from a transmitter means that the power density of the radiated wave at that new location is reduced to one - quarter of its previous value . </P> <P> The power density per surface unit is proportional to the product of the electric and magnetic field strengths . Thus , doubling the propagation path distance from the transmitter reduces each of these received field strengths over a free - space path by one - half . </P> <P> Radio waves in vacuum travel at the speed of light . The Earth 's atmosphere is thin enough that radio waves in the atmosphere travel very close to the speed of light , but variations in density and temperature can cause some slight refraction ( bending ) of waves over distances . </P> <H2> Modes ( edit ) </H2> <P> At different frequencies , radio waves travel through the atmosphere by different mechanisms or modes : </P> <Table> Radio frequencies and their primary mode of propagation <Tr> <Th_colspan=\\\"2\\\"> Band </Th> <Th> Frequency </Th> <Th> Wavelength </Th> <Th> Propagation via </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> ELF </Td> <Td> Extremely Low Frequency </Td> <Td> 3 -- 30 Hz </Td> <Td> 100,000 -- 10,000 km </Td> <Td> Guided between the Earth and the D layer of the ionosphere . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> SLF </Td> <Td> Super Low Frequency </Td> <Td> 30 -- 300 Hz </Td> <Td> 10,000 -- 1,000 km </Td> <Td> Guided between the Earth and the ionosphere . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> ULF </Td> <Td> Ultra Low Frequency </Td> <Td> 0.3 -- 3 kHz ( 300 -- 3,000 Hz ) </Td> <Td> 1,000 -- 100 km </Td> <Td> Guided between the Earth and the ionosphere . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> VLF </Td> <Td> Very Low Frequency </Td> <Td> 3 -- 30 kHz ( 3,000 -- 30,000 Hz ) </Td> <Td> 100 -- 10 km </Td> <Td> Guided between the Earth and the ionosphere . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> LF </Td> <Td> Low Frequency </Td> <Td> 30 -- 300 kHz ( 30,000 -- 300,000 Hz ) </Td> <Td> 10 -- 1 km </Td> <Td> Guided between the Earth and the ionosphere . <P> Ground waves . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> MF </Td> <Td> Medium Frequency </Td> <Td> 300 -- 3000 kHz ( 300,000 -- 3,000,000 Hz ) </Td> <Td> 1000 -- 100 m </Td> <Td> Ground waves . <P> E , F layer ionospheric refraction at night , when D layer absorption weakens . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> HF </Td> <Td> High Frequency ( Short Wave ) </Td> <Td> 3 -- 30 MHz ( 3,000,000 -- 30,000,000 Hz ) </Td> <Td> 100 -- 10 m </Td> <Td> E layer ionospheric refraction . <P> F1 , F2 layer ionospheric refraction . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> VHF </Td> <Td> Very High Frequency </Td> <Td> 30 -- 300 MHz ( 30,000,000 -- 300,000,000 Hz ) </Td> <Td> 10 -- 1 m </Td> <Td> Line - of - sight propagation . <P> Infrequent E ionospheric ( E ) refraction .

It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path ; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings , foliage and other obstructions . This is the most common propagation mode at VHF and above , and the only possible mode at microwave frequencies and above . On the surface of the Earth , line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles ( 64 km ) . This is the method used by cell phones , cordless phones , walkie - talkies , wireless networks , point - to - point microwave radio relay links , FM and television broadcasting and radar . Satellite communication uses longer line - of - sight paths ; for example home satellite dishes receive signals from communication satellites 22,000 miles ( 35,000 km ) above the Earth , and ground stations can communicate with spacecraft billions of miles from Earth . </P> <P> Ground plane reflection effects are an important factor in VHF line of sight propagation . The interference between the direct beam line - of - sight and the ground reflected beam often leads to an effective inverse - fourth - power ( 1 / distance ) law for ground - plane limited radiation . </P> <H3> Surface modes ( groundwave ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Surface wave <P> Lower frequency ( between 30 and 3,000 kHz ) vertically polarized radio waves can travel as surface waves following the contour of the Earth ; this is called groundwave propagation . </P> <P> In this mode the radio wave propagates by interacting with the conductive surface of the Earth . The wave `` clings '' to the surface and thus follows the curvature of the Earth , so groundwaves can travel over mountains and beyond the horizon . Ground waves propagate in vertical polarization so vertical antennas ( monopoles ) are required . Since the ground is not a perfect electrical conductor , ground waves are attenuated as they follow the Earth 's surface . Attenuation is proportional to frequency , so ground waves are the main mode of propagation at lower frequencies , in the MF , LF and VLF bands . Ground waves are used by radio broadcasting stations in the MF and LF bands , and for time signals and radio navigation systems . </P> <P> At even lower frequencies , in the VLF to ELF bands , an Earth - ionosphere waveguide mechanism allows even longer range transmission . These frequencies are used for secure military communications . They can also penetrate to a significant depth into seawater , and so are used for one - way military communication to submerged submarines . </P> <P> Early long distance radio communication ( wireless telegraphy ) before the mid-1920s used low frequencies in the longwave bands and relied exclusively on ground - wave propagation . Frequencies above 3 MHz were regarded as useless and were given to hobbyists ( radio amateurs ) . The discovery around 1920 of the ionospheric reflection or skywave mechanism made the medium wave and short wave frequencies useful for long distance communication and they were allocated to commercial and military users . </P> <H3> Ionospheric modes ( skywave ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Skywave <P> Skywave propagation , also referred to as skip , is any of the modes that rely on reflection ( actually refraction ) of radio waves from the ionosphere . The ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere from about 60 to 500 km ( 37 to 311 mi ) that contains layers of charged particles ( ions ) which can refract a radio wave back toward the Earth . A radio wave directed at an angle into the sky can be reflected back to Earth beyond the horizon by these layers , allowing long distance radio transmission . The F2 layer is the most important ionospheric layer for long - distance , multiple - hop HF propagation , though F1 , E , and D - layers also play significant roles . The D - layer , when present during sunlight periods , causes significant amount of signal loss , as does the E-layer whose maximum usable frequency can rise to 4 MHz and above and thus block higher frequency signals from reaching the F2 - layer . The layers , or more appropriately `` regions '' , are directly affected by the sun on a daily diurnal cycle , a seasonal cycle and the 11 - year sunspot cycle and determine the utility of these modes . During solar maxima , or sunspot highs and peaks , the whole HF range up to 30 MHz can be used usually around the clock and F2 propagation up to 50 MHz is observed frequently depending upon daily solar flux 10.7 cm radiation values . During solar minima , or minimum sunspot counts down to zero , propagation of frequencies above 15 MHz is generally unavailable . </P> <P> Although the claim is commonly made that two - way HF propagation along a given path is reciprocal , that is , if the signal from location A reaches location B at a good strength , the signal from location B will be similar at station A because the same path is traversed in both directions . However , the ionosphere is far too complex and constantly changing to support the reciprocity theorem . The path is never exactly the same in both directions . In brief , conditions at the two terminii of a path generally cause dissimilar polarization shifts , dissimilar splits into ordinary rays and extraordinary or Pedersen rays which have difference propagation characteristics due to differences in ionization density , shifting zenith angles , effects of the Earth 's magnetic dipole contours , antenna radiation patterns , ground conditions and other variables . </P> <P> Forecasting of skywave modes is of considerable interest to amateur radio operators and commercial marine and aircraft communications , and also to shortwave broadcasters . Real - time propagation can be assessed by listening for transmissions from specific beacon transmitters . </P> Meteor scattering ( edit ) <P> Meteor scattering relies on reflecting radio waves off the intensely ionized columns of air generated by meteors . While this mode is very short duration , often only from a fraction of second to couple of seconds per event , digital Meteor burst communications allows remote stations to communicate to a station that may be hundreds of miles up to over 1,000 miles ( 1,600 km ) away , without the expense required for a satellite link . This mode is most generally useful on VHF frequencies between 30 and 250 MHz . </P> Auroral backscatter ( edit ) <P> Intense columns of Auroral ionization at 100 km altitudes within the auroral oval backscatter radio waves , including those on HF and VHF . Backscatter is angle - sensitive -- incident ray vs. magnetic field line of the column must be very close to right - angle . Random motions of electrons spiraling around the field lines create a Doppler - spread that broadens the spectra of the emission to more or less noise - like -- depending on how high radio frequency is used . The radio - auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to middle latitudes . The occurrence of radio - auroras depends on solar activity ( flares , coronal holes , CMEs ) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima . Radio aurora includes the so - called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang - minima , the late - night radio aurora ( sub-storming phase ) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread . The propagation range for this predominantly back - scatter mode extends up to about 2000 km in east - west plane , but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes . </P> <P> Rarely , a strong radio - aurora is followed by Auroral - E , which resembles both propagation types in some ways . </P> Sporadic - E propagation ( edit ) Main article : Sporadic E propagation <P> Sporadic E ( Es ) propagation can be observed on HF and VHF bands . It must not be confused with ordinary HF E-layer propagation . Sporadic - E at mid-latitudes occurs mostly during summer season , from May to August in the northern hemisphere and from November to February in the southern hemisphere . There is no single cause for this mysterious propagation mode . The reflection takes place in a thin sheet of ionisation around 90 km height . The ionisation patches drift westwards at speeds of few hundred km per hour . There is a weak periodicity noted during the season and typically Es is observed on 1 to 3 successive days and remains absent for a few days to reoccur again . Es do not occur during small hours ; the events usually begin at dawn , and there is a peak in the afternoon and a second peak in the evening . Es propagation is usually gone by local midnight . </P> <P> Observation of radio propagation beacons operating around 28.2 MHz , 50 MHz and 70 MHz , indicates that maximum observed frequency ( MOF ) for Es is found to be lurking around 30 MHz on most days during the summer season , but sometimes MOF may shoot up to 100 MHz or even more in ten minutes to decline slowly during the next few hours . The peak - phase includes oscillation of MOF with periodicity of approximately 5 ... 10 minutes . The propagation range for Es single - hop is typically 1000 to 2000 km , but with multi-hop , double range is observed . The signals are very strong but also with slow deep fading . </P> <H3> Tropospheric modes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Radio waves in the VHF and UHF bands can travel somewhat beyond the visual horizon due to refraction in the troposphere , the bottom layer of the atmosphere below 20 km . This is due to changes in the refractive index of air with temperature and pressure . Tropospheric delay is a source of error in radio ranging techniques , such as the Global Positioning System ( GPS ) . In addition , unusual conditions can sometimes allow propagation at greater distances : </P> Tropospheric ducting ( edit ) Main article : Tropospheric ducting <P> Sudden changes in the atmosphere 's vertical moisture content and temperature profiles can on random occasions make UHF , VHF and microwave signals propagate hundreds of kilometers up to about 2,000 kilometers ( 1,200 miles ) -- and for ducting mode even farther -- beyond the normal radio - horizon . The inversion layer is mostly observed over high pressure regions , but there are several tropospheric weather conditions which create these randomly occurring propagation modes . Inversion layer 's altitude for non-ducting is typically found between 100 and 1,000 meters ( 330 and 3,280 feet ) and for ducting about 500 to 3,000 meters ( 1,600 to 9,800 feet ) , and the duration of the events are typically from several hours up to several days . Higher frequencies experience the most dramatic increase of signal strengths , while on low - VHF and HF the effect is negligible . Propagation path attenuation may be below free - space loss . Some of the lesser inversion types related to warm ground and cooler air moisture content occur regularly at certain times of the year and time of day . A typical example could be the late summer , early morning tropospheric enhancements that bring in signals from distances up to few hundred kilometers for a couple of hours , until undone by the Sun 's warming effect . </P> Tropospheric scattering ( troposcatter ) ( edit ) Main article : Tropospheric scattering <P> At VHF and higher frequencies , small variations ( turbulence ) in the density of the atmosphere at a height of around 6 miles ( 9.7 km ) can scatter some of the normally line - of - sight beam of radio frequency energy back toward the ground . In tropospheric scatter ( troposcatter ) communication systems a powerful beam of microwaves is aimed above the horizon , and a high gain antenna over the horizon aimed at the section of the troposphere though which the beam passes receives the tiny scattered signal . Troposcatter systems can achieve over-the - horizon communication between stations 500 miles ( 800 km ) apart , and the military developed networks such as the White Alice Communications System covering all of Alaska before the 1960s , when communication satellites largely replaced them . </P> Rain scattering ( edit ) <P> Rain scattering is purely a microwave propagation mode and is best observed around 10 GHz , but extends down to a few gigahertz -- the limit being the size of the scattering particle size vs. wavelength . This mode scatters signals mostly forwards and backwards when using horizontal polarization and side - scattering with vertical polarization . Forward - scattering typically yields propagation ranges of 800 km . Scattering from snowflakes and ice pellets also occurs , but scattering from ice without watery surface is less effective . The most common application for this phenomenon is microwave rain radar , but rain scatter propagation can be a nuisance causing unwanted signals to intermittently propagate where they are not anticipated or desired . Similar reflections may also occur from insects though at lower altitudes and shorter range . Rain also causes attenuation of point - to - point and satellite microwave links . Attenuation values up to 30 dB have been observed on 30 GHz during heavy tropical rain . </P> Airplane scattering ( edit ) Main article : Airplane scatter <P> Airplane scattering ( or most often reflection ) is observed on VHF through microwaves and , besides back - scattering , yields momentary propagation up to 500 km even in mountainous terrain . The most common back - scatter applications are air - traffic radar , bistatic forward - scatter guided - missile and airplane - detecting trip - wire radar , and the US space radar . </P> Lightning scattering ( edit ) <P> Lightning scattering has sometimes been observed on VHF and UHF over distances of about 500 km . The hot lightning channel scatters radio - waves for a fraction of a second . The RF noise burst from the lightning makes the initial part of the open channel unusable and the ionization disappears quickly because of recombination at low altitude and high atmospheric pressure . Although the hot lightning channel is briefly observable with microwave radar , no practical use for this mode has been found in communications . </P> <H3> Other effects ( edit ) </H3> Diffraction ( edit ) <P> Knife - edge diffraction is the propagation mode where radio waves are bent around sharp edges . For example , this mode is used to send radio signals over a mountain range when a line - of - sight path is not available . However , the angle can not be too sharp or the signal will not diffract . The diffraction mode requires increased signal strength , so higher power or better antennas will be needed than for an equivalent line - of - sight path . </P> <P> Diffraction depends on the relationship between the wavelength and the size of the obstacle . In other words , the size of the obstacle in wavelengths . Lower frequencies diffract around large smooth obstacles such as hills more easily . For example , in many cases where VHF ( or higher frequency ) communication is not possible due to shadowing by a hill , it is still possible to communicate using the upper part of the HF band where the surface wave is of little use . </P> <P> Diffraction phenomena by small obstacles are also important at high frequencies . Signals for urban cellular telephony tend to be dominated by ground - plane effects as they travel over the rooftops of the urban environment . They then diffract over roof edges into the street , where multipath propagation , absorption and diffraction phenomena dominate . </P> Absorption ( edit ) <P> Low - frequency radio waves travel easily through brick and stone and VLF even penetrates sea - water . As the frequency rises , absorption effects become more important . At microwave or higher frequencies , absorption by molecular resonances in the atmosphere ( mostly from water , H O and oxygen , O ) is a major factor in radio propagation . For example , in the 58 -- 60 GHz band , there is a major absorption peak which makes this band useless for long - distance use . This phenomenon was first discovered during radar research in World War II . Above about 400 GHz , the Earth 's atmosphere blocks most of the spectrum while still passing some - up to UV light , which is blocked by ozone - but visible light and some of the near - infrared is transmitted . Heavy rain and falling snow also affect microwave absorption . </P> <H2> Measuring HF propagation ( edit ) </H2> <P> HF propagation conditions can be simulated using radio propagation models , such as the Voice of America Coverage Analysis Program , and realtime measurements can be done using chirp transmitters . For radio amateurs the WSPR mode provides maps with real time propagation conditions between a network of transmitters and receivers . Even without special beacons the realtime propagation conditions can be measured : a worldwide network of receivers decodes morse code signals on amateur radio frequencies in realtime and provides sophisticated search functions and propagation maps for every station received . </P> <H2> Practical effects ( edit ) </H2> <P> The average person can notice the effects of changes in radio propagation in several ways . </P> <P> In AM broadcasting , the dramatic ionospheric changes that occur overnight in the mediumwave band drive a unique broadcast license scheme , with entirely different transmitter power output levels and directional antenna patterns to cope with skywave propagation at night . Very few stations are allowed to run without modifications during dark hours , typically only those on clear channels in North America . Many stations have no authorization to run at all outside of daylight hours . Otherwise , there would be nothing but interference on the entire broadcast band from dusk until dawn without these modifications . </P> <P> For FM broadcasting ( and the few remaining low - band TV stations ) , weather is the primary cause for changes in VHF propagation , along with some diurnal changes when the sky is mostly without cloud cover . These changes are most obvious during temperature inversions , such as in the late - night and early - morning hours when it is clear , allowing the ground and the air near it to cool more rapidly . This not only causes dew , frost , or fog , but also causes a slight `` drag '' on the bottom of the radio waves , bending the signals down such that they can follow the Earth 's curvature over the normal radio horizon . The result is typically several stations being heard from another media market -- usually a neighboring one , but sometimes ones from a few hundred kilometers away . Ice storms are also the result of inversions , but these normally cause more scattered omnidirection propagation , resulting mainly in interference , often among weather radio stations . In late spring and early summer , a combination of other atmospheric factors can occasionally cause skips that duct high - power signals to places well over 1000 km away . </P> <P> Non-broadcast signals are also affected . Mobile phone signals are in the UHF band , ranging from 700 to over 2600 Megahertz , a range which makes them even more prone to weather - induced propagation changes . In urban ( and to some extent suburban ) areas with a high population density , this is partly offset by the use of smaller cells , which use lower effective radiated power and beam tilt to reduce interference , and therefore increase frequency reuse and user capacity . However , since this would not be very cost - effective in more rural areas , these cells are larger and so more likely to cause interference over longer distances when propagation conditions allow . </P> <P> While this is generally transparent to the user thanks to the way that cellular networks handle cell - to - cell handoffs , when cross-border signals are involved , unexpected charges for international roaming may occur despite not having left the country at all . This often occurs between southern San Diego and northern Tijuana at the western end of the U.S. / Mexico border , and between eastern Detroit and western Windsor along the U.S. / Canada border . Since signals can travel unobstructed over a body of water far larger than the Detroit River , and cool water temperatures also cause inversions in surface air , this `` fringe roaming '' sometimes occurs across the Great Lakes , and between islands in the Caribbean . Signals can skip from the Dominican Republic to a mountainside in Puerto Rico and vice versa , or between the U.S. and British Virgin Islands , among others . While unintended cross-border roaming is often automatically removed by mobile phone company billing systems , inter-island roaming is typically not . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Radio portal </Li> </Ul> Main article : List of radio propagation terms <Ul> <Li> Anomalous propagation </Li> <Li> Diversity scheme </Li> <Li> Earth bulge </Li> <Li> Earth - ionosphere waveguide </Li> <Li> Electromagnetic radiation </Li> <Li> F2 propagation </Li> <Li> Fading </Li> <Li> Fresnel zone </Li> <Li> Free space </Li> <Li> Inversion ( meteorology ) </Li> <Li> Kennelly -- Heaviside layer </Li> <Li> Near and far field </Li> <Li> Non-line - of - sight propagation </Li> <Li> Radio atmospherics </Li> <Li> Radio frequency </Li> <Li> Radio horizon </Li> <Li> Radio propagation model </Li> <Li> Rayleigh fading </Li> <Li> Ray tracing ( physics ) </Li> <Li> Schumann resonance </Li> <Li> Skip ( radio ) </Li> <Li> Skip zone </Li> <Li> Skywave </Li> <Li> Tropospheric propagation </Li> <Li> TV and FM DX </Li> <Li> Upfade </Li> <Li> Vertical and horizontal ( radio propagation ) </Li> <Li> VOACAP - Free professional HF propagation prediction software </Li> <Li> Critical frequency </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ H.P.

      "    \"long_answer\": \"<P> Line - of - sight refers to radio waves which travel directly in a line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna . It does not necessarily require a cleared sight path ; at lower frequencies radio waves can pass through buildings , foliage and other obstructions . This is the most common propagation mode at VHF and above , and the only possible mode at microwave frequencies and above . On the surface of the Earth , line of sight propagation is limited by the visual horizon to about 40 miles ( 64 km ) . This is the method used by cell phones , cordless phones , walkie - talkies , wireless networks , point - to - point microwave radio relay links , FM and television broadcasting and radar . Satellite communication uses longer line - of - sight paths ; for example home satellite dishes receive signals from communication satellites 22,000 miles ( 35,000 km ) above the Earth , and ground stations can communicate with spacecraft billions of miles from Earth . </P>\",\n",

As such , the island is neither a sovereign nation nor a U.S. state . Because of that ambiguity , the territory , as a polity , lacks certain rights but enjoys certain benefits that other polities have or lack . For instance , in contrast to sovereign nations , Puerto Rico does not have voting rights in its federal legislature nor in electing its federal head of government . But , in contrast to U.S. states , Puerto Ricans are not subject to federal income taxes . The political status of the island thus stems from how different Puerto Rico is politically from sovereign nations and from U.S. states . </P>\",\n",
